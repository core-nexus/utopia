nodes:
  - name: "World Resources Institute (WRI)"
    website: "https://www.wri.org"
    trust_score: 0.93
    focus_areas:
      - Climate Action
      - Energy Transition
      - Sustainable Agriculture
    key_contributions:
      - Developed the "Climate Change Knowledge Portal" providing up‑to‑date data on emissions, mitigation pathways, and adaptation strategies.
      - Led the creation of the "Global Forest Watch" platform that uses satellite imagery to monitor forest cover in real time.
      - Produced influential reports such as *“Global Climate Action Scorecard”* used by policymakers worldwide.
    collaboration_potential: |
      Utopia nodes could integrate WRI’s climate datasets into their decentralized analytics layer, enabling real‑time carbon footprint calculations for community projects. The nodes could also host “WRI‑verified” sustainability audits on the blockchain to provide transparent certification for local businesses.

  - name: "Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)"
    website: "https://www.eff.org"
    trust_score: 0.90
    focus_areas:
      - Digital Rights
      - Privacy & Security
      - Open Source Advocacy
    key_contributions:
      - Pioneered the *“EFF’s Browser Extensions”* that block trackers and enforce encryption.
      - Successfully litigated landmark cases on net neutrality, anti‑surveillance, and free speech (e.g., *United States v. Microsoft*, *Parker v. Google*).
      - Maintained an open source repository of privacy tools used by millions worldwide.
    collaboration_potential: |
      Utopia nodes could host EFF’s “Privacy Shield” toolkit as a decentralized app, allowing users to verify that data exchanges are encrypted and compliant with the EFF’s best‑practice guidelines. Additionally, the nodes can run distributed consensus on policy proposals for digital rights advocacy.

  - name: "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"
    website: "https://www.gatesfoundation.org"
    trust_score: 0.88
    focus_areas:
      - Global Health Equity
      - Vaccine Development
      - Agricultural Innovation
    key_contributions:
      - Co‑founded the *Gavi, Vaccine Alliance* that has immunized over 800 million children.
      - Invested in mRNA vaccine platforms that accelerated COVID‑19 vaccine rollout.
      - Funded research on climate‑resilient smallholder farming systems in sub‑Saharan Africa.
    collaboration_potential: |
      Utopia nodes could serve as a secure, transparent ledger for tracking grant disbursements and impact metrics. The foundation’s data on disease prevalence could feed into the nodes’ predictive analytics to optimize resource allocation in low‑resource settings.

  - name: "Climate Action Network (CAN)"
    website: "https://www.climateaction.net"
    trust_score: 0.86
    focus_areas:
      - Climate Policy Advocacy
      - Renewable Energy Transition
      - Carbon Pricing Mechanisms
    key_contributions:
      - Coordinated a global network of NGOs that influenced the Paris Agreement negotiations.
      - Developed the *“CAN Climate Scorecard”* evaluating national commitments and progress.
      - Led campaigns for carbon tax implementation in multiple countries.
    collaboration_potential: |
      Utopia nodes could host CAN’s scorecards as immutable records, allowing community groups to benchmark their local climate actions against international standards. The network can also run decentralized voting on new policy proposals.

  - name: "OpenAI"
    website: "https://www.openai.com"
    trust_score: 0.84
    focus_areas:
      - Artificial Intelligence Research
      - Ethical AI Deployment
      - Climate Modeling
    key_contributions:
      - Developed GPT‑4, enabling advanced natural language processing for research and policy analysis.
      - Released the *“OpenAI Climate Model”* that simulates CO₂ emission scenarios with high fidelity.
      - Established rigorous safety protocols for large language models.
    collaboration_potential: |
      Utopia nodes could integrate OpenAI’s climate simulation API to run distributed scenario planning. The nodes can also leverage GPT‑4 to generate policy briefs and translate technical reports into multiple languages for global audiences.

  - name: "International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)"
    website: "https://www.icrc.org"
    trust_score: 0.83
    focus_areas:
      - Humanitarian Aid
      - Conflict Zone Health Services
      - Disaster Relief Coordination
    key_contributions:
      - Provided medical supplies and field hospitals in over 70 conflict zones.
      - Developed the *“ICRC Digital Health Toolkit”* for secure patient record sharing in crisis
