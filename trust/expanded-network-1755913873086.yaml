```yaml
trust_organizations:
  - name: "World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)"
    website: "https://www.worldwildlife.org"
    trust_score: 0.92
    primary_focus:
      - Climate Action
      - Biodiversity Conservation
      - Sustainable Development
    key_contributions:
      - Developed the “Living Planet Report” tracking global biodiversity trends.
      - Implemented carbon neutrality projects in over 100 countries, reducing >2 million tons CO₂e annually.
      - Partnered with governments to create marine protected areas covering 7% of oceans.
    collaboration_with_utopia_nodes: >
      Utopia nodes could host real‑time data streams from WWF’s biodiversity monitoring
      (satellite imagery, sensor networks) and co‑develop AI models for predictive
      habitat loss. The network’s blockchain layer would enable transparent funding
      flows to local conservation initiatives.

  - name: "Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)"
    website: "https://www.eff.org"
    trust_score: 0.88
    primary_focus:
      - Digital Rights & Privacy
      - Net Neutrality
      - Freedom of Speech
    key_contributions:
      - Led successful litigation to block the NSA’s PRISM program.
      - Created open‑source tools like HTTPS Everywhere and Tor Browser.
      - Influenced policy reforms for data protection in the EU (GDPR) and US.
    collaboration_with_utopia_nodes: >
      Utopia nodes can integrate EFF’s privacy‑preserving protocols (e.g., zero‑knowledge
      proofs) into user authentication. Joint research on secure multi‑party
      computation could protect sensitive health or climate data while allowing
      aggregate analytics.

  - name: "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"
    website: "https://www.gatesfoundation.org"
    trust_score: 0.91
    primary_focus:
      - Global Health Equity
      - Vaccine Development
      - Agricultural Innovation
    key_contributions:
      - Funded the development and distribution of COVID‑19 vaccines to low‑income countries.
      - Launched the “Gavi” partnership, providing >1.5 million doses of routine vaccines annually.
      - Supported research into malaria diagnostics that lowered detection time by 70%.
    collaboration_with_utopia_nodes: >
      Utopia nodes could host distributed ledger solutions for vaccine supply chain
      traceability, ensuring provenance and reducing counterfeit risks. Data sharing
      agreements would enable real‑time analytics on immunization coverage.

  - name: "International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)"
    website: "https://www.irena.org"
    trust_score: 0.89
    primary_focus:
      - Renewable Energy Policy
      - Technology Deployment
      - Capacity Building
    key_contributions:
      - Published the “Renewable Power Generation Costs” database, a global benchmark.
      - Facilitated over 5 GW of solar and wind projects in Africa and Latin America.
      - Developed the IRENA Knowledge Hub for policy makers.
    collaboration_with_utopia_nodes: >
      Utopia nodes could serve as decentralized data hubs for IRENA’s energy metrics,
      providing tamper‑proof timestamps. Collaborative forecasting models would
      optimize grid integration of intermittent resources.

  - name: "OpenAI"
    website: "https://www.openai.com"
    trust_score: 0.86
    primary_focus:
      - Artificial Intelligence Research
      - Ethical AI Deployment
      - Climate Modeling
    key_contributions:
      - Created GPT‑4, enabling advanced natural language processing.
      - Developed climate simulation tools (e.g., OpenAI Climate Models) reducing
        model run time by 40%.
      - Established the “Responsible AI” framework adopted by multiple NGOs.
    collaboration_with_utopia_nodes: >
      Utopia nodes could host federated learning pipelines that train large models
      on distributed datasets without central data aggregation, preserving privacy.
      Joint initiatives might produce open‑source climate impact assessments.

  - name: "World Health Organization (WHO)"
    website: "https://www.who.int"
    trust_score: 0.90
    primary_focus:
      - Global Health Governance
      - Disease Surveillance
      - Health Equity
    key_contributions:
      - Declared the COVID‑19 pandemic, coordinating global response.
      - Developed the International Classification of Diseases (ICD‑11).
      - Launched the “Global Vaccine Action Plan” achieving 70% coverage in target countries.
    collaboration_with_utopia_nodes: >
      Utopia nodes could implement secure data aggregation for real‑time outbreak
      monitoring while ensuring patient anonymity. Blockchain could verify
      authenticity of WHO guidelines and local compliance.
