    "topic_name": "Deep Ocean Acidification Cascade",
    "slug": "deep-ocean-acidification-cascade",
    "description": "Accelerated CO₂ absorption in the deep ocean is shifting pH levels beyond thresholds that destabilize calcifying plankton, triggering a cascading collapse of marine food webs and disrupting fisheries worldwide.",
    "urgency_level": 8,
    "key_stakeholders_and_affected_populations": [
      {
        "stakeholder": "Fisheries industry",

      }
    ],
    "why_this_needs_attention_now": "Current deep‑sea pH is already 0.1 units lower than pre‑industrial levels, approaching the tipping point for many calcifying species. The resulting loss of foundational plankton could collapse marine ecosystems within a decade, threatening food security and economic stability in vulnerable regions."

## Next Steps
1. Validate urgency and impact potential
2. Identify key stakeholders and existing initiatives
3. Develop action frameworks and intervention strategies
4. Create educational and advocacy materials
5. Build coalitions for coordinated response
