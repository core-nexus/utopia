# Research Report – “Emerging‑14”  
*(A comprehensive, data‑driven analysis of the most pressing global challenge identified as “Emerging‑14” – Climate‑Resilient Development in Small Island Developing States (SIDS).)*  

> **Why SIDS?**  
> Small Island Developing States are disproportionately exposed to climate‑related hazards while possessing limited adaptive capacity. They embody the “emerging‑14” narrative: a set of 14 high‑impact, low‑visibility challenges that threaten global sustainability, equity, and security. Addressing them requires coordinated science, policy, finance, and community action.
