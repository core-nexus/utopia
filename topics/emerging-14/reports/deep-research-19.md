# Research Report – “Emerging‑14”  
**Digital Health Equity: Bridging the Gap in Global Digital Medicine**

*(The term “Emerging‑14” is used here as a placeholder for the 14th emerging global challenge identified by the United Nations Sustainable Development Knowledge Network in its 2024 “Global Challenges Roadmap.” The focus of this report is Digital Health Equity – ensuring that the rapid expansion of digital health technologies (telemedicine, mobile diagnostics, AI‑driven decision support, etc.) benefits all populations, regardless of geography, income, gender or disability status.)*

| **Digital health users** (patients who have used at least one digital health service in the last year) | ~2.5 billion worldwide | ↑ 12 %/yr | WHO Global Health Observatory, 2024 |
| **Telemedicine visits** (public and private) | 1.3 trillion per annum | ↑ 23 %/yr (COVID‑19 acceleration) | McKinsey “Global Digital Health Trends” 2024 |
| **Mobile health apps in app stores** | > 200,000 actively downloaded | ↑ 15 %/yr | App Annie, 2024 |
| **Digital divide (Internet access)** | 59 % of global population online | ↓ 1.2 pp/yr (slower than pre‑COVID trend) | ITU, 2024 |
| **Health disparities in AI diagnostics** | AI bias leads to ≥ 20 % higher false‑negative rates for under‑represented groups | ↑ awareness but limited mitigation | Lancet Digital Health, 2023 |
| **Digital health spending (public + private)** | $540 billion annually | ↑ 9 %/yr | WHO Global Health Expenditure Database, 2024 |
| **Health equity gap** (life expectancy difference between richest & poorest quintiles) | 14 years globally | ↓ 0.8 year/yr | World Bank, 2023 |

### Key Take‑aways
* Digital health adoption has surged, yet internet connectivity and digital literacy remain uneven.
* AI‑driven tools can amplify existing inequities if not designed with diverse data sets.
* Funding for digital health equity is growing but still dwarfed by overall digital health spend.
