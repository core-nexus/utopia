## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Global Status (latest year) | Trend (2018–2024) |
|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Ocean acidification** – pH decline | −0.08 units since 1992 (≈ 7% drop in carbonate saturation) | Accelerating; projected +0.12 units by 2050 if emissions continue unabated (IPCC 2021) |
| **Marine biodiversity loss** – species assessed as “threatened” | ~ 30 % of assessed marine species (IUCN Red List, 2024 update) | Increasing at ~ 3–5 % per decade |
| **Coastal fisheries yield** – global catch (t) | 180 million tonnes in 2022 (FAO) – 15 % decline since 2010 | Stabilizing only in a few high‑latitude regions; declining elsewhere |
| **Plastic pollution** – marine litter (tons) | ~ 8.3 million tonnes of plastic enter oceans annually (UNEP, 2024) | Rising by ~ 2 % per year despite bans on single‑use plastics |
| **Coral reef health** – bleaching events | 12 major bleaching events recorded since 2000; 40 % of global reefs show ≥ 50 % cover loss (Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, 2024) | Frequency of severe bleaching has increased by ~ 30 % per decade |
| **Coastal erosion** – shoreline retreat | Global average retreat ≈ 5.3 m/decade (IPCC AR6, 2021) | Accelerating in low‑lying island nations and deltas |
| **Marine protected area (MPA) coverage** | 7.9 % of global ocean surface designated as MPAs (UNEP-WCMC, 2024) | Target of 30 % by 2030 not met; only 3 % of high‑productivity zones protected |

*Key Takeaway:* Ocean health is deteriorating at a pace that threatens food security, climate regulation, and socio‑economic stability for over 2.5 billion people.
