## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Emerging‑14 Average | Global Average |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Population (2023) | 2.9 billion | 7.8 billion |
| % of global population | 37% | 100% |
| CO₂ emissions (MtCO₂eq, 2022) | 5,600 | 36,000 |
| Urbanisation rate | 64% | 55% |
| Digital penetration (mobile subscriptions per 100 people) | 122 | 87 |
| Health spending (% of GDP) | 3.9% | 8.5% |
| Renewable energy share of installed capacity | 18% | 27% |

**Key take‑aways**

* The Emerging‑14 collectively accounts for ~37 % of the world’s population but only ~15 % of global CO₂ emissions – a paradox that underscores their potential to lead low‑carbon development.  
* Urbanisation is accelerating faster than in any other region, creating both opportunities (economies of scale) and pressures (infrastructure, waste).  
* Health spending remains below the global average, yet these countries are experiencing rapid epidemiological transitions: rising non‑communicable diseases (NCDs), infectious disease outbreaks, and ageing populations.
