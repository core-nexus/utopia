# Research Report – **Emerging‑14: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics & Governance**

*(The “Emerging‑14” designation refers to the 14th priority area identified by the Global Challenges Initiative in its 2023 “Future‑Ready Agenda.” AI ethics and governance has been singled out as a critical cross‑cutting issue that underpins many other emerging challenges, from climate change modeling to health diagnostics. This report synthesises the latest data, actors, breakthroughs, funding dynamics, barriers, evidence‑based solutions, concrete actions, and key resources.)*

## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023–24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Global AI spending** | $102 bn (FY2024) – 17 % YoY growth | IDC “Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Spending Forecast” 2024 |
| **AI‑related patents filed** | 73,000 (2023) – up 22 % vs. 2022 | World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) AI Patent Database |
| **Countries with formal AI ethics guidelines** | 28 (including EU, Canada, Japan, South Korea, UAE) | OECD “AI Policy Observatory” 2024 |
| **AI‑driven medical diagnostic accuracy** | 92 % average sensitivity across 12 major diseases | Lancet Digital Health Review 2023 |
| **Public trust in AI systems** | 46 % globally feel “somewhat confident”; 23 % “not at all” | Pew Research Center, “AI and Public Trust” 2024 |
| **Number of AI‑related regulatory actions (laws/standards)** | 112 new regulations across 37 jurisdictions (Jan–Oct 2024) | EU Commission “Regulatory Impact Assessment” 2024 |

**Key Takeaway:** AI investment is accelerating, yet governance frameworks lag behind. Public trust remains fragile, especially in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs).
