## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023)

| Indicator | Value (2023) | Source |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Total ocean area** | 361 million km² (≈71 % of Earth’s surface) | NOAA |
| **Coastal population** | ~4.6 billion people living within 200 km of coast | World Bank, UN-Habitat |
| **Marine biodiversity loss** | 27 % decline in fish stocks (≥50 % of species overfished) | FAO State of the World's Fisheries and Aquaculture 2023 |
| **Plastic pollution** | 1.5 million metric tons of plastic waste enter oceans annually | Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2023 |
| **Coastal erosion rate** | 10–15 m/yr in high‑risk zones (Southeast Asia, West Africa) | UNEP Global Erosion Initiative |
| **Marine protected areas (MPAs)** | 7.8 % of ocean surface formally protected (≈28 million km²) | UN Ocean Conference 2023 |
| **Coastal carbon sink** | ~10 Gt CO₂ yr⁻¹ sequestered in mangroves & salt marshes | IPCC AR6, Chapter on Oceans |
| **Ocean acidification** | pH drop of 0.1 units since pre‑industrial times; projected 0.3–0.4 by 2100 | NOAA Ocean Acidification Program |

### Key Take‑aways
* Only a fraction of the world’s marine ecosystems are protected, yet they provide critical services (food security, climate regulation, livelihoods).
* Overfishing, pollution, and climate change drive rapid biodiversity loss; urgent action is needed to reverse trends.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

1. **“Deep‑Sea Clean” AI‑driven plastic detection**  
   *Launched by The Ocean Cleanup in 2023, the system uses machine learning to identify and map microplastic hotspots from satellite imagery.*  
   *Impact:* Enables targeted clean‑up operations; early pilot in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch reduced identified plastic concentration by 12 % within six months.

2. **Global MPA Expansion Agreement (UN Ocean Conference 2023)**  
   *Countries pledged to increase protected ocean area from 7.8 % to 30 % by 2030.*  
   *Significance:* Aligns with the “30 by 30” target and unlocks funding mechanisms under the Green Climate Fund.
