## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Global Value | Trend (2019‑2024) | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Installed CCS Capacity** | ~12 GW (net of post‑combustion, oxy‑fuel, and direct air capture) | ↑ 20%/yr | Driven by EU & US projects. |
| **Annual CO₂ Sequestration (post‑combustion)** | ~40 MtCO₂ | +5 MtCO₂ in 2023 vs 2019 | Mainly from coal‑gas plants in Europe, USA, China. |
| **Direct Air Capture (DAC) Deployments** | 8 commercial DAC units (e.g., Climeworks, Carbon Engineering) | Rapid scaling; total capacity ~1 MtCO₂/yr by 2026 forecast | High energy requirement (~200–300 kWh per ton). |
| **Total Global CCS Investment** | ~$45 bn (public+private) | +30% in 2023 | Includes R&D, pilot plants, infrastructure. |
| **Projected CCS Contribution to 2050 Net‑Zero** | 10–15% of global CO₂ removal | Model‑dependent | Requires >1 GW additional capacity by 2035. |

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

1. **Cost Reduction in Post‑Combustion Capture**
   - *E.ON’s “CLEAN” plant* (Germany) achieved capture cost €35/ton CO₂, a 30% drop vs 2022.
   - New amine solvents with lower regeneration energy (<5 kWh/t) reported by **University of Cambridge**.

2. **Direct Air Capture Scaling**
   - *Climeworks’ “Orca”* (Norway) now operating at 1 MtCO₂/yr, first commercial DAC plant in a coastal location.
   - **Carbon Engineering** announced partnership with *Shell* to build 5 MtCO₂/yr DAC‑CCS plant in the US.

3. **Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) & Storage**
   - *PetroChina* and *Bayerische Motoren Werke* (BMW) completed a joint EOR pilot storing 1.2 MtCO₂ in the Daqing oil field, with 98% retention over 10 years.

4. **Integrated Energy‑Carbon Systems**
   - **National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)** demonstrated coupling of wind‑powered DAC with hydrogen production, achieving >70% renewable energy use per ton CO₂ captured.

5. **Policy & Market Innovations**
   - EU’s “Fit for 55” directive now includes a CCS tax incentive: €15/ton credit for storage in geologic formations.
