## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Global Value (2023) | Trend (2010–2023) |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Urban population** | 5.2 bn people (68% of world pop.) | ↑4.5 %/yr |
| **City‑level CO₂ emissions** | 1,500 MtCO₂ (≈30 % of global) | ↑0.8 %/yr |
| **Energy use in buildings** | 28 % of total energy consumption | ↑1.2 %/yr |
| **Access to safe public transport** | 45 % of urban dwellers in low‑income cities | ↓0.3 %/yr (stagnation) |
| **Urban waste generation** | 2.04 t per capita (global average) | ↑1.6 %/yr |
| **Green space per person** | 8 m² (average across OECD cities) | ↓0.5 %/yr |
| **Air‑quality index (PM₂.₅)** | 62 µg/m³ (world avg) | ↑2.1 %/yr |

*Key Takeaway:* Urban centers are the biggest drivers of climate change, waste, and inequity – yet they also hold the greatest potential for transformative action.
