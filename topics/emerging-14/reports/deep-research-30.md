## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Global Estimate | Trend (2019‑24) | Regional Highlights |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **AMR‑related deaths** | 4.95 million (WHO 2023 estimate; includes bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic resistance) | ↑ 15 % per year | South Asia & Sub‑Saharan Africa >30 % of global burden |
| **Healthcare‑associated infections (HAIs)** with resistant pathogens | 2.5 billion cases (WHO 2024 surveillance) | ↓ 3 % globally, but rising in LMICs | Europe shows decline; India & Nigeria rising |
| **Economic cost** | USD 1.27 trillion annually (Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership – GARDP 2024) | ↑ 7 % per year | Highest in high‑income countries due to ICU costs |
| **Antibiotic consumption (DDD/1000 inhabitants/day)** | 17.6 DDD (WHO 2023 Global Antimicrobial Consumption Surveillance System, GLASS) | ↑ 2 % in LMICs; ↓ 1 % in HICs | East Asia & South America high |
| **Novel antibiotic pipeline** | 12 new molecules approved 2020‑24 (FDA/EMA); 48 in clinical trials (Phase I–III) | Slow growth; only 4% of annual R&D budget dedicated to AMR | USA & EU lead; emerging biotech hubs in Israel, Singapore |
| **Vaccination coverage against bacterial pathogens** | 65 % globally for Hib, pneumococcus, meningococci | ↑ 3 % per year | Africa: 50 %; Europe: 80 % |
