| **Share of misinformation flagged as AI‑generated** | 18 % of all flagged pieces in the U.S., 24 % in EU, 12 % in Asia | *European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO), 2024* |
| **Speed of spread** | Average reach time: 2.3 h from first post to 10 k engagements (vs. 5.6 h for human‑written) | *Twitter & TikTok analytics, 2023* |
| **Economic impact** | Estimated $14.8 bn lost annually in fraud, stock manipulation, and political polarization costs | *World Economic Forum, “Misinformation Cost Report”, 2024* |
| **Public trust decline** | 62 % of U.S. adults report “low confidence” that online news is accurate; 48 % in EU | *Pew Research Center, “Trust & Technology”, 2024* |
