## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Estimate (2023–24) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global AI health‑tech market size** | USD $30.5 bn (projected CAGR 19.4% 2023–2030) | McKinsey “AI in Health Care: A 2023 Outlook” |
| **Number of AI‑enabled clinical decision‑support tools in EU/US** | ~1,200 commercial & research systems | FDA & EMA product databases |
| **Percentage of hospitals with any AI deployment (survey 2024)** | 42 % worldwide; 57 % US; 31 % EU | HIMSS AI Adoption Index 2024 |
| **Clinical trials using AI (clinicaltrials.gov, 2023‑24)** | 1,200+ interventional studies; 350 active in 2024 | ClinicalTrials.gov |
| **AI‑based diagnostic accuracy vs. human experts** | Sensitivity/Specificity ≥ 90% for radiology, pathology, ophthalmology in > 70% of trials | Systematic review: *JAMA Netw Open* 2023 |
| **Estimated annual cost savings from AI implementation (US)** | USD $4–5 bn (efficiency + error reduction) | Accenture “Health Care’s New Frontier” 2023 |

**Key Take‑aways**

- The AI‑health market is expanding rapidly, driven by regulatory approvals and pay‑or‑play value propositions.
- Adoption is uneven: high‑income countries lead; low‑ and middle‑income settings lag due to infrastructure & workforce gaps.
- Evidence for clinical benefit is growing but still limited in many therapeutic areas (e.g., oncology, mental health).
