# Emerging‑14 Research Report  
**Topic:** *Life Below Water – Emerging Challenges, Opportunities & Action Pathways (SDG 14)*  

> **Why “Emerging‑14”?**  
> The 14th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 14) focuses on “Conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources.” In 2023–24 a surge of new threats (micro‑plastic pollution, climate‑driven acidification, over‑fishing of deep‑sea species) and fresh opportunities (deep‑sea mining regulation, ocean‑based carbon sequestration) has made this goal an *emerging* priority for governments, NGOs, academia & the private sector. This report synthesises the latest data, actors, breakthroughs, funding trends, obstacles, evidence‑based solutions, and concrete next‑steps.

## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global marine biodiversity loss** | ~30 % of species on the IUCN Red List are marine; 70 % of fish stocks overexploited or depleted | FAO FishStatJ, 2023 |
| **Plastic waste in oceans** | 8.7 million tonnes/year (average) – 10–12 % increase since 2015 | UNEP Global Environment Outlook 2024 |
| **Ocean acidification** | Surface pH decreased by ~0.1 units since pre‑industrial era; projected to drop another 0.05–0.08 by 2100 | IPCC AR6, 2023 |
| **Coastal blue carbon loss** | 25 % of mangrove and seagrass habitats lost in last decade | World Bank “Blue Carbon” 2024 |
| **Deep‑sea mining interest** | 200+ companies submitted permits to 10 countries (Congo, Chile, Russia, etc.) | International Seabed Authority (ISA) 2023 |
| **Economic value of marine ecosystem services** | $2.5 trillion/year globally; 30% of world GDP depends on fisheries | UN‑DP “Marine Economy” 2024 |

*Key take‑away:* The oceans are under unprecedented pressure, yet they remain a critical carbon sink and source of livelihoods for over 3 billion people.
