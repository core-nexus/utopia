# Research Report – **Emerging‑14: Micro‑Plastic Pollution**  
*(A comprehensive, data‑driven analysis of the fastest‑growing environmental crisis affecting oceans, freshwater systems, and human health.)*

## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Metric | Global Estimate (2023) | Source |
|--------|-----------------------|--------|
| **Annual micro‑plastic production** | ~12 billion kg (≈12 Mt) of plastic waste → 0.7–2 % becomes micro‑plastics | *UNEP, “Global Plastic Watch”* |
| **Micro‑plastics in the oceans** | > 3 trillion particles per square kilometre at the surface; > 10 billion tonnes in all ocean waters | *Science Advances 2024* |
| **Freshwater micro‑plastic burden** | 1.8–2.5 % of suspended solids in major rivers (e.g., Amazon, Ganges) | *Nature Communications 2023* |
| **Human exposure** | 10–50 µg per person per day via food, water, and air | *Environmental Science & Technology 2024* |
| **Economic impact** | $1.5 trillion annually in fisheries, tourism, and health costs (IPCC‑adapted estimate) | *World Bank, “Plastic Pollution: The Cost of Inaction”* |

### Key Trends

- **Urbanisation & plastic use**: Rapid urban growth in Asia & Africa is accelerating micro‑plastic generation.  
- **Regulatory lag**: Only 29 countries have national micro‑plastic monitoring frameworks (2024).  
- **Bioaccumulation**: Micro‑plastics are now detected in > 90 % of marine species sampled worldwide, including top predators and humans.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

1. **Enzymatic Degradation**  
   - *2019* (Huang et al.) first reported PET‑degrading enzyme PETase; *2023* breakthrough: engineered PETase with > 20× catalytic efficiency, now in pilot scale by *BASF*.  

2. **Micro‑plastic Sensors & Analytics**  
   - 2024 release of the *Open‑Plastic Spectrometer* (OPSi), a low‑cost, portable Raman spectrometer enabling real‑time field detection of micro‑plastics < 10 µm.  

3. **Policy Milestones**  
   - EU’s “Micro‑plastic Directive” adopted in 2024: bans micro‑beads in cosmetics; sets limits on micro‑fibres from textiles (≤ 0.1
