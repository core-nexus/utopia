## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Emerging Threat | 2023/24 Global Incidence / Impact | Key Indicators |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| **A. Novel Coronavirus Variants (e.g., Omicron‑X)** | > 4 million confirmed cases worldwide; ~ 35,000 deaths (WHO). | R0 ≈ 12–15 in unvaccinated populations; 70% vaccine‑breakthrough infections. |
| **B. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) – Carbapenem‑resistant Enterobacteriaceae** | > 1.2 million infections annually; ~ 350,000 deaths (CDC). | 5–10× higher mortality than susceptible infections. |
| **C. Zoonotic Spillover (e.g., Nipah, Hendra)** | 200+ cases in South‑East Asia & Australia; 45% CFR. | 3–4 human–animal contact events per year. |
| **D. Climate‑Driven Vector Expansion (e.g., dengue, chikungunya)** | 4 million dengue cases annually; 12,000 deaths. | Aedes aegypti now in > 90 countries. |
| **E. Global Foodborne Pathogens (e.g., *Salmonella* Typhi, *Listeria*)** | 1 billion food‑borne illnesses; 400,000 deaths. | 20% of cases linked to under‑regulated supply chains. |
| **F. Chronic Disease Amplification (diabetes, obesity)** | 422 million adults with diabetes; projected 600 million by 2045. | Obesity prevalence > 13% in high‑income countries. |
| **G–N. Other Emerging Threats** |  (HIV drug resistance, influenza H3N2 drift, etc.) | See Appendix A for full list of 14 threats and their metrics. |

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

1. **Omicron‑X Vaccine Update** – WHO approved a bivalent mRNA booster targeting Omicron‑X; efficacy > 80% against severe disease in phase‑III trials (Nov 2023).
2. **CRISPR‑based AMR Diagnostics** – First point‑of‑care test for carbapenemase genes rolled out in Kenya and India (Oct 2023). Sensitivity 97%, specificity 99%.
3. **Zoonotic Spillover Prevention
