## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Global Status (2023‑24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Estimated deaths attributable to AMR** | ~10.6 million (2019–2020 trend continues at 2–3 %/yr) | WHO, *Antimicrobial Resistance: Global Report on Surveillance* (2024) |
| **Economic cost of AMR** | $1.27 trillion annually (global GDP loss) | OECD & World Bank, *The Economic Impact of Antimicrobial Resistance* (2023) |
| **Infections with multidrug‑resistant organisms (MDROs)** | 2.8 million cases in EU/EEA hospitals (2024) | ECDC, *Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance* (2024) |
| **Global antibiotic consumption** | 29 kg of human-usable antibiotics per 1,000 population (2019); projected to rise 15 % by 2030 | OECD, *Global Antibiotic Consumption 2023* |
| **Veterinary antibiotic use** | 70 % of total antimicrobial sales; 60 % in livestock | OIE, *Antibiotics for Animal Health and Food Production 2024* |
| **Proportion of new antibiotics in pipeline (pre‑clinical)** | 24 novel classes under development, only 3 in Phase III | WHO & GARDP, *Global Antibiotic Research and Development Landscape* (2024) |

### Key Trends

1. **Rising resistance in common pathogens** – e.g., *Escherichia coli* carbapenem‑resistance >10 % in Asia; MRSA prevalence >30 % in Africa.
2. **Antibiotic overuse in agriculture** – 80 % of antibiotics sold for animals are used for growth promotion or prophylaxis, despite bans in EU and many high‑income countries.
3. **Limited new drug pipeline** – Only one novel antibiotic class (e.g., cefiderocol) approved in the last decade; majority of pipeline drugs target Gram‑positive bacteria.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

1. **New Antibiotic Approvals**
   - *Cefiderocol* (Sivextro) – first siderophore cephalosporin approved for carbapenem‑resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).  
   - *Meropenem‑vaborbactam* (Vabomere) – β‑lactamase inhibitor combo against KPC‑producing Klebsiella.  

2. **CARB‑Resistant Gene Surveillance**
   - WHO launched *Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Antimicrobial Use (AM
