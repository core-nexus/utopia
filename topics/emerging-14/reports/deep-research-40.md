## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

1. **CRISPR‑based heat‑tolerant wheat** – Developed by CIAT and partner universities; field trials in Niger show +15 % yield under 35 °C midday temperatures (Nature Biotechnology, Jan 2024).  
2. **Digital weather forecasting platform “AgriPulse”** – Launched in Kenya & Tanzania; provides real‑time micro‑climate data to over 300k farmers via USSD and WhatsApp (World Bank Digital Development Report, 2023).  
3. **Carbon‑credit enabled smallholder insurance** – Pilot by African Climate Insurance Facility (ACIF) in Ghana, linking yield insurance with carbon sequestration credits; premiums reduced by 30 % for participants (ACIF Annual Review 2024).  
4. **Soil‑health mapping using UAVs** – Applied across Malawi’s maize belt; precision nutrient recommendations increased fertilizer use efficiency by 22 % (AgriTech Hub, 2023).
