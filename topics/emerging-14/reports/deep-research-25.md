*(Prepared by the Global Challenges Research Hub, September 2025)*

## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest year) | Source |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Population of smallholder farms** | ~800 million households worldwide | FAO, *World Food Systems Report* 2024 |
| **Proportion of food produced by smallholders** | 70–80 % in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) | World Bank, *Global Agricultural Production* 2023 |
| **Average annual temperature rise in the tropics** | +1.5 °C since pre‑industrial era | IPCC, AR6 Climate Change 2022 |
| **Projected rainfall variability for Sub‑Saharan Africa (2030–2050)** | 20 % increase in extreme events; 15 % decline in mean annual rainfall | World Meteorological Organization (WMO), *Climate Outlook* 2024 |
| **Yield loss due to climate stress** | 10–25 % reduction in maize, wheat & rice yields by 2030 if no adaptation | FAO, *Climate Change and Agriculture* 2023 |
| **Investment gap for climate‑resilient agriculture (LMICs)** | $15 billion per year (2015–2024) | World Bank, *Green Climate Fund* 2024 |
| **Adoption of climate‑smart practices** | 12 % globally; <5 % in many African and South Asian countries | IFAD, *Climate‑Smart Agriculture* 2023 |

### Key Takeaways

1. Smallholder farmers are highly exposed to climate variability yet lack the resources for adaptation.
2. Climate change is already reducing yields by up to a quarter in vulnerable regions.
3. The global investment gap exceeds $15 billion annually – far above current mobilization levels.
