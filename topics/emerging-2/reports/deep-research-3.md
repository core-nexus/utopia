## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data  

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global AI market size** | USD 1.3 trillion (2024 projection, CAGR 28% 2020‑2028) | *IDC, “Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Market Forecast”* |
| **Countries with national AI strategies** | 48 of 195 UN member states | *World Economic Forum, “Global AI Governance Survey 2024”* |
| **AI‑related policy proposals in US Congress (2023–24)** | 14 bills introduced; 2 passed into law (AI Accountability Act 2024) | U.S. Congress Records |
| **EU AI Act regulatory framework** | Effective 1 Jan 2025 for high‑risk AI systems | *European Commission, “Regulation on Artificial Intelligence”* |
| **Number of AI ethics boards worldwide** | ~1,200 (public + private) | *AI Governance Network, 2024* |
| **Public trust in AI (global survey)** | 38 % trust AI for decision‑making; 22 % distrust; 40 % undecided | *Pew Research Center, “Artificial Intelligence: Public Perception” (2023)* |

### Key Trends

1. **Rapid commercialization** – Over 70 % of Fortune 500 companies have deployed at least one high‑risk AI system (e.g., facial recognition, credit scoring).  
2. **Regulatory patchwork** – The EU AI Act is the most comprehensive yet, while the U.S. remains largely sectoral and state‑level.  
3. **Ethics–compliance gap** – 61 % of organizations with an ethics board report that guidelines are “advisory only” and not legally binding.
