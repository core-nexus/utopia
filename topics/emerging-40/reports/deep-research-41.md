# Research Report – **Digital Health Equity in Low‑ and Middle‑Income Countries (LMICs)**  
*(“Emerging‑40” = the 40th most pressing global health challenge according to the Global Health Security Index 2023)*  

> Digital health equity refers to the fair, timely, and quality access to digital health technologies (telemedicine, e‑prescribing, mobile health apps, electronic medical records, AI diagnostics) for all population groups in LMICs. It is a critical lever for achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC), reducing health disparities, and meeting Sustainable Development Goal 3 targets.

## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data  

| Indicator | Value (2024 est.) | Source |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Global digital‑health market** | US$ 430 bn, CAGR 20% (2020–2035) | IDC, “Digital Health Market Outlook” 2024 |
| **LMICs share of global digital‑health spending** | 22 % (≈US$ 94 bn) | GSMA Mobile Economy 2023 |
| **Internet penetration in LMICs** | 56 % (vs. 90 % globally) | World Bank, Global ICT Outlook 2024 |
| **Mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people** | 115 % (many dual‑SIM households) | GSMA Mobile Economy 2023 |
| **Telemedicine visits in LMICs** | 5.6 M/month (est.) | WHO Global Telehealth Report 2023 |
| **Digital health workforce gaps** | 1.8 million health workers lack basic digital skills | Lancet Digital Health 2023 |
| **Health equity gap** | 30 % of rural populations in sub‑Saharan Africa have no access to any digital health service | UNICEF, “Health & Education” 2024 |

*Key take‑away:* While mobile penetration is high, the translation into equitable health services remains uneven. Digital skills gaps and fragmented policy frameworks are major bottlenecks.
