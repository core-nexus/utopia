### 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Metric | Value (latest 2023/early 24) | Source |
|--------|------------------------------|--------|
| **Total 5G‑enabled mobile subscriptions** | ~2.9 billion (≈ 38 % of global mobile users) | GSMA, *Mobile Economy* 2024 |
| **Countries with commercial 5G launch** | 112 | GSMA |
| **Projected 5G coverage by 2030** | 80 % of world population | ITU‑ICT Forecast 2023 |
| **Annual global investment in 5G infrastructure (2022–23)** | $170 billion | Deloitte, *Future of Mobile* 2024 |
| **Average data speed in 5G networks (urban)** | 1.8 Gbps down / 0.9 Gbps up | 3GPP Release 18 trials |
| **Latency in commercial 5G** | < 10 ms | 3GPP, *Technical Report TR 38.900* |
| **Edge computing nodes deployed (global)** | ~55 k | Cisco Annual Cybersecurity Report 2024 |
| **Number of enterprises with private 5G networks** | 12 k (up 45 % YoY) | Ericsson, *Private Network Adoption* 2024 |

> **Key Insight:** While commercial 5G is now available in over a third of the world’s population, coverage gaps remain large in rural and low‑income regions, limiting equitable access.
