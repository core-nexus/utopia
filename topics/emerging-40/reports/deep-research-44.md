## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (2023‑24) | Source |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Global AI in Healthcare Market Size** | USD $210 billion (2024 projection; CAGR ≈ 28% 2023‑2030) | *Statista* |
| **Number of AI‑enabled diagnostic tools approved by FDA** | 132 devices (last 12 months) | FDA database |
| **Clinical trials using AI for drug discovery** | 1,045 active trials; 312 in Phase I–II | ClinicalTrials.gov |
| **AI adoption in oncology diagnostics** | 38% of U.S. cancer centers use AI‑assisted pathology | AACR Survey 2023 |
| **Estimated global cost savings from AI integration (by 2030)** | USD $3.2 trillion | McKinsey Global Institute |
| **Digital health penetration in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs)** | 32% of population with smartphone access; only 5% of health facilities have AI tools | WHO Digital Health Atlas 2024 |

**Key Takeaways**

* The market is expanding faster than traditional medical technology sectors.
* Regulatory approvals are accelerating, especially in the U.S., EU, and Japan.
* Adoption remains uneven: high‑income countries lead, while LMICs lag due to infrastructure gaps.
