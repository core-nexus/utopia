## 1. Current Global & National Statistics

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global** | • 771 million people lack access to an improved water source.<br>• 3.4 billion drink unsafe water (UN‑WHO, 2023). | UN‑World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP), 2023 |
| **Ghana – National** | • 97 % of urban households have “improved” water sources; only 81 % in rural areas.<br>• 23 % of Ghanaian population still relies on unprotected springs, ponds or rivers.<br>• Estimated 1.5 million people (≈ 4 % of total) lack reliable safe drinking water at home. | Ministry of Sanitation & Water Resources (MSWR), Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), 2023 |
| **Health Impact** | • In Ghana, 12 % of all diarrheal disease cases in children under five are linked to unsafe water.<br>• Annual cost of untreated water‑borne diseases: USD 1.6 billion (healthcare + lost productivity). | WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), 2023 |
| **Infrastructure** | • 2,300 new boreholes drilled annually in Ghana (2019–2024 average).<br>• 40 % of boreholes <5 years old are non‑functional due to poor maintenance. | Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL), 2024 |

### Key Takeaway
Ghana is close to universal coverage, yet a persistent rural gap and infrastructure fragility keep millions at risk.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

1. **Solar‑Powered Borehole Pumps**  
   - Pilot in Upper West Region: 30 new solar pumps installed, reducing operating costs by 70 % and extending borehole lifespan to >10 years (GSS, 2024).  

2. **Community Water Management Digital Platform** – *“WASH‑Connect”*  
   - Launched nationwide; integrates GIS mapping, real‑time water quality alerts, and community reporting. Early adopters report a 45 % faster response to contamination incidents (GWCL & Microsoft Africa, 2024).  

3. **Low‑Cost Point‑of‑Use Filters**  
   - A partnership between the Gates Foundation and local manufacturers produced filters costing USD 15 per unit; field trials in Ashanti Region achieved >99 % reduction in E. coli levels (WHO/UNICEF, 2023).  

4. **Water Quality Surveillance Network**  
   - Ghana Statistical Service implemented a cloud‑based surveillance system using mobile data collection; coverage expanded from 200 to 1,500 sampling points nationwide by mid‑2024 (GSS
