## 1. Current Global & National Statistics

| Indicator | Global (2023) | Ghana (2023 est.) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Population with access to safely managed drinking‑water services** | 71 % of global population (UN-Water, 2023) | 68 % of the national population (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme – JMP 2023) |
| **Population without safe drinking water** | 1.7 billion people worldwide | ~5.2 million people (~10 %) lack safely managed services |
| **Water‑borne disease incidence** | 4 million DALYs lost annually (WHO, 2023) | 70 % of reported diarrhoeal cases linked to unsafe water sources |
| **Annual per capita expenditure on drinking water in Ghana** | $7.5 (World Bank, 2022) | $6.8 (Ghana Statistical Service, 2023) |
| **Proportion of rural households relying on unimproved sources** | 24 % globally | 42 % in Ghana (JMP 2023) |
| **Water infrastructure investment gap** | USD 1.4 trillion needed to meet SDG‑6 by 2030 (World Bank, 2022) | $5.7 billion annual gap for safe water & sanitation (UNDP, 2023) |

### Key Takeaways
- Ghana’s access rate is slightly below the global average and still far from the SDG‑6 target of 90 % by 2030.
- Rural areas lag significantly behind urban centers in both coverage and quality.
- The majority of water‑borne illnesses remain linked to inadequate source protection and treatment.
