## Summary
**Road‑map for a Community‑Scale Solar‑Powered Desalination Pilot in Ghana**

| Phase | Key Actions | Technology Options | Cost Ranges (USD) | Notes |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **1. Feasibility & Site Selection** | • Conduct solar resource assessment (Ghana’s coastal insolation ≈ 5–6 kWh/m²/day). <br>• Map water quality and demand for 10–30 m³/day.<br>• Identify flat, low‑land sites with minimal shading, proximity to the coast, and access to a local grid or battery storage. | • Solar PV modules (monocrystalline or polycrystalline).<br>• Small‑scale reverse osmosis (RO) units (1–5 m³/day per module). | • Site survey & GIS: $5k–$10k.<br>• Water quality testing: $2k. | Use Kyocera’s solar panel packaging approach (cells + glass + aluminum frame) for durability in humid coastal climates. |
| **2. System Design** | • Size PV array to meet 80 % of RO energy demand (≈ 0.5–1 kW per m³/day).<br>• Select a power conditioner (inverter) that converts DC from panels to AC for the RO pump and controls battery charging.<br>• Integrate battery storage (Li‑ion or lead‑acid) to buffer diurnal variation. | • PV modules: 300–350 W each.<br>• Inverter: 5–10 kVA, 48 V DC input.<br>• Battery bank: 20–30 kWh capacity. | • PV array (10–15 kWp): $12k–$18k.<br>• Inverter & controls: $3k–$6k.<br>• Batteries: $8k–$12k. | Kyocera’s power‑conditioning guide highlights the importance of matching DC/AC ratios and protecting against over‑voltage in coastal environments. |
| **3. Procurement & Installation** | • Source modular, pre‑assembled PV racks and RO units from suppliers with West African presence (e.g., Siemens, Bosch).<br>• Engage local contractors for mounting, wiring, and commissioning.<br>• Train a small team of community technicians on basic maintenance. | • Modular PV racks (steel frames)<br>• Pre‑sealed RO membranes<br>• SCADA or simple monitoring dashboard | • Installation labor: $10k–$15k.<br>• Training & handover: $3k. | Emphasize components that are easy to replace locally; use Kyocera’s durable panel design to reduce corrosion risk. |
| **4. Operation & Maintenance (O&M)** | • Routine cleaning of panels (bi‑weekly).<br>• Monthly membrane checks and replacement schedule.<br>• Battery health monitoring quarterly.<br>• Establish a community governance committee for decision‑making and revenue sharing. | • Cleaning tools, spare membranes, battery electrolyte kits | • O&M annual cost: 5–8 % of CAPEX (~$1k–$2k). | Local skills can be built through partnerships with NGOs or technical schools; maintain a simple SOP manual. |
| **5. Monitoring & Reporting** | • Install basic SCADA to log PV output, pump operation, and water production.<br>• Generate monthly performance reports for stakeholders.<br>• Use open‑source dashboards (Grafana) to keep costs low. | • Data logger, internet connectivity (satellite or 4G). | • Monitoring system: $2k–$4k. | Transparent data builds trust and informs scaling decisions. |
| **6. Scaling & Phasing** | • Pilot (10 m³/day) → evaluate performance after 12 months.<br>• Scale to 30 m³/day by adding two additional RO modules and expanding PV array proportionally.<br>• Explore hybridization with diesel backup for critical periods if grid reliability is low. | • Additional PV panels, batteries, RO units | • Incremental CAPEX: $20k–$40k per 10 m³ increase. | Risk mitigation includes insurance against panel damage and a contingency fund for membrane replacement. |

### Assumptions & Calculations
- **Solar insolation**: 5.5 kWh/m²/day → 1 kWp yields ≈ 4.8 kWh/day.
- **RO energy requirement**: ~0.5 kW per m³/day (typical for small units).
- **Battery autonomy**: 2 days of operation without sun.
- **CAPEX estimate**: $250k–$500k covers PV, RO, batteries, inverter, installation, training, and contingency.

### Key Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Panel corrosion from salt spray | Use Kyocera’s marine‑grade panels; apply protective coatings. |
| Membrane fouling due to high salinity | Pre‑treat feed water with a simple sediment filter; schedule regular cleaning. |
| Grid unreliability | Design for off‑grid operation; include battery backup and optional diesel fallback. |
| Skill gaps in O&M | Provide hands‑on training, create SOPs, partner with local vocational schools. |

### Next Steps
1. **Secure funding**: Identify donors or micro‑finance options within the $250k–$500k window.
2. **Finalize site**: Conduct a detailed GIS and environmental assessment.
3. **Procure equipment**: Issue RFPs for PV modules, RO units, batteries, and inverters with emphasis on modularity.
4. **Build governance structure**: Form a community committee to oversee operations and revenue distribution.
5. **Implement pilot**: Install 10 m³/day system; monitor performance for 12 months.
