# Solar-Powered Desalination in Coastal Ghana
Roadmap, costs, sites, and next steps

---

## Problem & Goal
- Coastal communities face saline intrusion and scarcity.
- Goal: Pilot 10–30 m³/day, reliable and maintainable.

---

## Design Targets
- Energy: kWh/m³, recovery ratio, TDS limits.
- O&M: local skills, supply chain readiness.

---

## Option Space
- RO + pre-treatment, intake/outfall.
- Solar: grid-tied vs off-grid + storage.

---

## Costs (Ranges)
- CAPEX/OPEX and major drivers.
- Sensitivity to energy price and membrane life.

---

## Sites & Risks
- Siting criteria and constraints.
- Top risks and mitigations.

---

## Pilot Plan
- Phases, milestones, partners, KPIs.

---

## Call to Action
- Decision needed, next 30–60 days.
