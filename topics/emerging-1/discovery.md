    "slug": "ai-labor-fragmentation",
    "description_and_urgency_level": "The rapid deployment of generative AI, advanced robotics, and autonomous decision systems is reshaping the workforce in ways that current labor policies and education curricula have not anticipated. While some sectors experience productivity gains, others face structural unemployment, wage polarization, and a widening skills gap. The urgency stems from the fact that these changes are already accelerating: by 2026, estimates suggest up to 15 % of routine jobs could be displaced or significantly altered in OECD economies, while informal and low‑skill workers in emerging markets are at heightened risk.",

        "group": "Low‑skill and routine job holders",

    "why_this_needs_attention_now": "The technology is already altering employment landscapes; without coordinated action, we risk deepening inequality, eroding social cohesion, and creating political instability. Early intervention can shape policy, protect livelihoods, and harness AI’s benefits while mitigating its harms."

    "topic_name": "Permafrost‑Induced Hydrological Cascades in the Arctic–Pacific Nexus",
    "slug": "permafrost-hydrological-cascades",
    "description_and_urgency_level": "Recent permafrost thaw has accelerated meltwater release into Arctic coastal systems, leading to increased river discharge, altered sediment transport, and intensified ocean acidification in the Bering Sea. These hydrological cascades threaten fisheries, indigenous livelihoods, and global climate feedback loops. Urgency is high because projections show a 40‑50 % rise in thaw‑induced runoff by 2035, which could destabilize existing marine ecosystems and amplify greenhouse gas emissions.",

## Next Steps
1. Validate urgency and impact potential
2. Identify key stakeholders and existing initiatives
3. Develop action frameworks and intervention strategies
4. Create educational and advocacy materials
5. Build coalitions for coordinated response
