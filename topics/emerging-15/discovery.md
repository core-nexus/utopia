    "description": "Rapid deployment of generative AI and advanced automation is displacing routine, low‑skill jobs while creating high‑skill roles that require specialized training. The mismatch between available skills and new job requirements is widening income inequality, eroding social cohesion, and increasing the risk of large‑scale labor unrest in both developed and emerging economies.",

      "By 2025, projections estimate that up to 15% of the global workforce could be displaced by automation in high‑growth sectors.",
      "The lack of coordinated retraining programs is already causing social unrest in regions with high automation adoption (e.g., Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia).",

    "description": "While Arctic sea‑ice loss has dominated headlines, recent data show a rapid increase in CO₂ absorption and pH decline in sub‑polar waters (30–60° latitude). This acidification is already affecting calcifying plankton, which form the base of marine food webs. The cascading impacts threaten fisheries, coastal economies, and global carbon sequestration capacity.",

## Next Steps
1. Validate urgency and impact potential
2. Identify key stakeholders and existing initiatives
3. Develop action frameworks and intervention strategies
4. Create educational and advocacy materials
5. Build coalitions for coordinated response
