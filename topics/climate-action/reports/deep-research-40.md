## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023/24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Global average temperature rise** | +1.08 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2024) | IPCC 6th Assessment Report, AR6 WG1 (2023) |
| **CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere** | 421 ppm (average 2024) | NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory |
| **Net anthropogenic CO₂ emissions** | 36.2 Gt CO₂ yr⁻¹ (2023) | Global Carbon Project, “Carbon Budget Report” 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share of global generation** | 27.5 % (2023) | IEA “World Energy Outlook 2024” |
| **Global renewable capacity added in 2023** | +145 GW (mostly solar & wind) | REN21 “Renewables Global Status Report 2024” |
| **Projected 2050 emissions under current pledges** | 1.5–2.8 Gt CO₂ yr⁻¹ (depending on pathway) | IEA Net Zero 2050 Scenario 2023 |
| **Annual climate‑related economic losses worldwide** | $2.6 trillion in 2023 (up 15 % YoY) | World Bank “Climate Change: The Economics of Damage” 2024 |
| **Global forest loss** | 10.5 M ha per year (2019‑2023 avg) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Sea‑level rise rate (global mean)** | 3.6 mm yr⁻¹ (2022–23) | NOAA Sea Level Rise Report 2024 |

**Key Takeaway:**  
The planet is warming at a pace that exceeds the Paris Agreement’s “well‑below 2 °C” target. Global emissions are still increasing, and the economic costs of climate impacts continue to rise.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

| Year | Development | Impact Potential |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **2023** | **Direct Air Capture (DAC) scaling:** Global DAC capacity reaches ~1 Mt CO₂/yr; cost drops to $100‑$150 per tonne (from ~$600). | Large‑scale negative emissions potential. |
|  | **Battery price collapse:** Lithium‑ion cell prices fall below $100/kWh, enabling grid‑scale storage at <$200/kWh. | Enables higher renewable penetration. |
|  | **Carbon pricing expansion:** 30 new jurisdictions adopt carbon taxes or cap‑and‑trade (e.g., Brazil, South Africa). | Generates revenue for climate finance. |
| 2024 | **Methane mitigation tech:** AI‑driven leak detection reduces methane emissions from oil & gas by 25 % in pilot sites. | Cuts high‑potency GHGs rapidly. |
|  | **Biochar adoption
