## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2024)

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (April 2024) | NOAA ESRL (CO₂ Clock) |
| **Global mean temperature anomaly** | +1.11 °C relative to pre‑industrial (1850‑1900) | NASA GISS, 2023/24 update |
| **Annual global greenhouse gas emissions** | 9.7 Gt CO₂‑eq (2022; projected 10.4 Gt in 2030 under current pledges) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29 % of global electricity generation (2023) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Global renewable capacity added (2023)** | +55 GW (wind & solar) | IRENA Renewable Capacity Statistics 2024 |
| **Carbon intensity of global GDP** | 0.45 t CO₂‑eq per $1,000 GDP (2022) | World Bank SDG Energy & Climate Data |
| **Land‑use change emissions** | ~5 Gt CO₂‑eq annually (deforestation + conversion) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2023 |
| **Ocean acidification rate** | 0.004 pH units per decade (2000–2022) | NOAA Ocean Acidification Program |
| **Climate‑related extreme events** | 3,400+ deaths and $1.9 trn damages globally in 2022 | EM-DAT, 2024 |

### Regional Highlights

| Region | CO₂ concentration trend | Renewable share | Key challenge |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **North America** | 420 ppm (≈+0.6 ppm/yr) | 36 % | Methane leakage from fracking |
| **Europe** | 416 ppm | 45 % | Coal phase‑out lag in Eastern EU |
| **Asia‑Pacific** | 410 ppm | 28 % | Rapid urbanization & coal dependence |
| **Sub‑Saharan Africa** | 406 ppm | 12 % | Energy access deficit |
| **Latin America** | 415 ppm | 32 % | Deforestation in Amazonia |

> **Takeaway:** Global CO₂ concentrations are still rising at ~1.4 ppm per year (2023–24). Renewable penetration has increased but is insufficient to meet the Paris target of ≤1.5 °C without aggressive decarbonisation.
