## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (2023/24) | Trend |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** | 36.4 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ (≈ +0.8 % vs. 2022) | Increasing, though growth rate slowed from +1.6 % in 2019 |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (last measured Jan 2025) | Highest since the pre‑industrial era; > 4× fossil‑fuel emissions of 1990 |
| **Global temperature rise** | +1.2 °C above pre‑industrial (IPCC 6th Assessment, 2023) | Continues to accelerate; 2024 projected 1.25–1.35 °C |
| **Sea level rise** | 4.7 mm yr⁻¹ (last 5 yrs) | Faster than the 1990‑2000 average of 3.2 mm yr⁻¹ |
| **Arctic sea ice extent (June)** | 6.8 million km² (2024) | Lowest since satellite records began in 1979 |
| **Global renewable electricity share** | 29 % of total electricity generation (2023) | Up from 23 % in 2015 |
| **Carbon intensity of global energy mix** | 53 gCO₂/kWh (2024) | Down from 73 gCO₂/kWh in 2010 |
| **Net‑zero pledges (public & private)** | 1,300+ entities, covering ~70% of global GDP | 40% still unquantified or unverifiable |

**Key Takeaway:** Emissions are rising, but the pace has slowed slightly. However, cumulative emissions and atmospheric concentrations continue to climb, driving climate impacts that are already felt worldwide.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

### 3.1 Technological

| Innovation | Year | Impact / Status |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| **Direct Air Capture (DAC) with storage** | 2023 (Climeworks, Carbon Engineering) | First commercial DAC plant > 500 tCO₂/yr in Iceland; cost projected to drop to <$80/t by 2030 |
| **Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) scaling** | 2024 | Global deployed capacity hit 200 GW, reducing grid curtailment of renewables |
| **Hydrogen production via electrolysis powered by offshore wind** | 2023 | Pilot in Netherlands; projected to reach 50 MW by 2030 |
| **AI‑driven climate modeling (Exascale)** | 2024 | New models now resolve cloud feedbacks at < 1 km resolution, improving emission‑impact projections |

### 3.2 Policy

* **EU’s “Fit for 55” package** – Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) set to roll out in 2026; will affect > 30% of EU imports by 2030.
