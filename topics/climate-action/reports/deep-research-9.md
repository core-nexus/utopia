## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Global Status (2024) | Trend (2019‑24) |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (≈ 5 % higher than pre‑industrial) | ↑ 2.7 ppm/yr |
| **Global mean temperature** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial | ↑ 0.18 °C/decade |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 3.6 mm/yr (average, 1993‑2023) | ↑ 0.5 mm/yr acceleration |
| **Average annual global emissions** | 36.3 GtCO₂e (≈ 4 % lower than 2019) | ↓ 1.2 %/yr |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28 % of total generation | ↑ 6 pp/yr |
| **Net‑zero pledges** | 139 countries & 55 major emitters | ↑ 15 % annually |
| **Climate finance flows (public + private)** | $1.9 trn in 2023, 5 % higher than 2022 | ↑ 7 %/yr |
| **Carbon pricing coverage** | 35 jurisdictions covering ~25 % of global emissions | ↑ 10 % coverage |

### Key Take‑aways

* Emissions have plateaued but not yet declined enough to meet the Paris target.  
* Renewable penetration is accelerating, but fossil‑fuel phase‑out lags behind policy commitments.  
* Climate finance has surged, yet most funds remain in high‑risk projects (e.g., coal & gas) rather than low‑carbon transitions.
