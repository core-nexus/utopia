## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 420 ppm (≈ 0.042 %) | NOAA ESRL, 2023 |
| **Global mean surface temperature rise** | +1.11 °C above pre‑industrial (1850–1900) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions (net)** | 36.7 GtCO₂e | Global Carbon Project, 2023 |
| **Sectoral shares of emissions** | Energy: 73 %<br>Transport: 14 %<br>Industry: 11 %<br>Agriculture & land‑use: 12 % | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29 % of global generation (incl. hydro) | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report, Q3 2024 |
| **Global renewable capacity added (2023)** | +120 GW (wind & solar) | IRENA, 2024 |
| **Carbon‑negative technologies deployed** | 1.2 MtCO₂e net removal via BECCS and afforestation | Global Carbon Project, 2023 |
| **Climate finance to developing countries** | $42 bn (public + private) in 2023 | UNFCCC Green Climate Fund (GCF), 2024 |
| **Per‑capita carbon budget remaining (2030)** | ~12 tCO₂e per person (global average) | IPCC AR6, 2023 |

*Key take‑away:* Global emissions are plateauing but remain far above the Paris Agreement limits. Renewable capacity is growing rapidly, yet fossil fuel infrastructure still dominates.
