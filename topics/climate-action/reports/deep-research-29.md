## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2024)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | **≈ 421 ppm** (average of 2023‑24) | NOAA, Earth System Research Laboratory |
| **Global mean temperature increase** | **+1.07 °C above pre‑industrial** (1850‑1900) | IPCC AR6 WG1 |
| **Annual global greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂eq)** | **≈ 59 Gt CO₂eq** in 2023, projected **62 Gt by 2030** if current trends continue | IEA Emissions Gap Report 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share of total generation** | **28.5 %** (global average) | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Global investment in low‑carbon technologies** | **$1.9 trillion** (FY 2023, inclusive of public & private finance) | BloombergNEF “Energy Transition Outlook” 2024 |
| **Climate‑related extreme events (≥ 100 deaths)** | **> 650 incidents worldwide** in 2023 | EM-DAT International Disaster Database |
| **Global carbon budget remaining (1.5 °C pathway)** | **≈ 400 Gt CO₂eq** until 2030 | IPCC AR6, Synthesis Report |
| **Per‑capita emissions by region** | *Africa:* ~0.3 t CO₂e, *Asia-Pacific:* ~4.2 t, *Europe:* ~5.8 t, *North America:* ~15.7 t | World Bank 2023 GHG Inventory |

### Key Take‑aways
* The global temperature trajectory is still on a warming path that exceeds the Paris Agreement 1.5 °C target unless emissions are cut by > 45 % by 2030.
* Renewable energy capacity continues to grow, yet fossil fuel investment remains dominant in many regions.
* Climate finance gaps persist: $3.7 trillion of public climate finance is required annually through 2030 (World Bank 2024), but only ~$1.2 trillion has been mobilized.
