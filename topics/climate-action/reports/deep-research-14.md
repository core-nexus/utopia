## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023/24) | Source |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | 36.3 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Annual temperature rise vs pre‑industrial** | +1.11 °C (2023) | NASA GISS; NOAA 2024 Climate Report |
| **Average global sea level rise (2000‑2023)** | 3.7 mm yr⁻¹ | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2022 |
| **Percentage of renewable electricity generation** | 29% of total electricity supply | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Global forest cover loss** | 10.5 m ha yr⁻¹ (2023) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Carbon budget remaining to stay below 1.5 °C** | ~300 GtCO₂ (at 50% confidence) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2022 |
| **Global climate finance disbursed (public + private)** | $420 bn in 2023 | Climate Policy Initiative, *Climate Finance Tracker* |
| **Number of countries with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** | 193 (all UNFCCC parties) | UNFCCC |

**Key Take‑aways**

1. CO₂ emissions have plateaued only briefly; the last decade has seen a ~10 % increase relative to 2010 levels.  
2. Renewable electricity penetration is rising but still below the 2030 pathway required for net‑zero by 2050.  
3. Climate finance, while growing, remains far short of the $1.5‑$2 trillion per year needed (per the Paris Agreement’s *climate finance* goal).

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑24)

### 3.1 Technological

| Breakthrough | Description | Impact |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| **Direct Air Capture (DAC) scaling** | Carbon Engineering and Climeworks scaled first commercial DAC plants to >200 tCO₂/yr each in 2024. | Demonstrated viability of negative emissions at scale; cost now <$100/tonne for pilot units. |
| **Advanced battery chemistries** | Lithium‑sulfur & solid‑state batteries achieving >500 Wh/kg energy density. | Enables grid-scale storage, reduces PV cost by up to 20%. |
| **Carbon‑neutral aviation fuels** | Boeing and
