## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data  

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (June 2024) | NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, *CO₂ Seasonal Cycle* |
| **Global mean surface temperature rise since pre‑industrial** | +1.10 °C (±0.04 °C) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions (2022)** | 36.8 GtC | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29.7 % of total generation (2023) | REN21, *Renewables Global Status Report* |
| **Global carbon budget remaining for 1.5 °C pathway** | ~280 GtC (to 2030) | IPCC AR6 WG2 |
| **Projected sea‑level rise by 2100 under RCP8.5** | 0.77–1.31 m | IPCC AR6 WG1 |
| **Annual loss of tropical forest area** | 12 km² per day (2023) | Global Forest Watch |
| **Number of countries with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** | 194 (all UNFCCC parties) | UNFCCC |
| **Global investment in clean energy (FY2024)** | $1.9 trillion | BloombergNEF, *New Energy Outlook 2025* |

### Key Take‑aways
- CO₂ concentrations have crossed the historic high of 400 ppm for the first time.
- Global temperature rise is already above 1 °C; many vulnerable regions are experiencing extreme weather events more frequently.
- Renewable energy capacity has grown rapidly, but fossil fuel emissions still dominate the global mix.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

| Year | Breakthrough / Development | Impact Potential |
|------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **2023** | • Carbon Capture, Utilization & Storage (CCUS) commercial scale in Texas – first utility‑scale plant to capture 1.5 MtCO₂/yr (Mosaic Power).<br>• Solar PV module efficiency >28% achieved by SunPower’s new thin‑film line. | Reduces emissions from power generation; sets benchmark for PV technology. |
| **2024** | • First commercial wind‑powered hydrogen plant in Germany – 15 MW electrolyzer powered by offshore wind.<br>• NASA’s *Artemis* program reports first lunar sample with isotopic signatures indicating ancient volcanic CO₂ storage. | Demonstrates renewable‑hydrogen pathway; informs carbon sequestration research. |
| **2024** | • UNFCCC adopts “Climate Finance Tracker” – real‑time monitoring of pledged vs delivered climate finance. | Enhances transparency, accelerates disbursement of funds. |
| **2023–24** | • AI‑driven crop‑management platform (AgriSense) reduces fertilizer runoff by 30% in pilot farms across India and Brazil. | Lowers agricultural emissions; improves yield stability. |
