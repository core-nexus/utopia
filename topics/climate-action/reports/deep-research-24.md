## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023/24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂‑equivalent emissions** | 36.5 GtCO₂e per year (≈ 7.4 % increase vs. 2022) | *IEA* “World Energy Outlook 2024” |
| **Average global temperature rise** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023) | IPCC |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 420 ppm (Jan‑Feb 2025 average) | NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29.8 % of global generation (2023) | REN21 “Renewables Global Status Report” |
| **Global renewable capacity added (2024)** | 122 GW (wind + solar + hydro) | IRENA |
| **Climate‑finance flows to developing countries** | $52 bn in 2023, 20 % of total climate finance | UNFCCC “Annual Report on Climate Finance” |
| **Carbon‑neutral commitments by major economies** | 45 countries have net‑zero targets (≤2050) | UNEP “Climate Ambition Tracker” |

### Key Trends

* **Energy transition acceleration:** Solar PV installations grew 23 % in 2024; offshore wind capacity doubled between 2019–24.
* **Carbon removal market growth:** Direct air capture (DAC) projects scaled from <10 MtCO₂/yr to ~50 MtCO₂/yr by 2024.
* **Policy momentum:** 82 countries enacted or updated climate laws in 2023‑24; EU’s “Fit for 55” package passed.
