## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023)

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (average 2023) – up 2.4 ppm/yr from 2019 | NOAA ESRL, Global Monitoring Laboratory |
| **Global mean temperature rise** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2023 mean) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | 36.5 GtCO₂e (FY2023) – ~0.4 % increase from FY2022 | IEA, World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28.8 % of total electricity generation (2023) – +1.5 ppy | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Net‑zero pledges by countries** | 139 nations with net‑zero targets, 70% binding | Climate Action Tracker, 2024 |
| **Global forest loss** | 10 million ha lost in 2023 (deforestation rate: 0.18 %/yr) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2023 |
| **Extreme heat days** | 1,200+ record‑breaking hot days globally in 2023 | NASA Earth Observations |
| **Climate finance disbursed** | $420 bn in climate-related public and private finance (FY2024) | Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) Finance Tracker |

*Key Takeaway:*  
- Global emissions are still rising, but the pace of decarbonisation is accelerating.  
- Renewable share growth has outpaced fossil‑fuel decline.  
- Climate finance is expanding but remains below the $100 bn annual target set by the Paris Agreement for developing countries.
