## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023–2024) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** | 36.6 GtCO₂e (≈ 0.94 GtCO₂e per capita, 2023) | UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2024 |
| **Annual temperature rise** | +1.1 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2024) | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 4.7 mm /yr (average 2013–2022) | NOAA, 2024 Global Sea Level Observing System |
| **Permafrost thaw rate** | 1.5 km of active layer deepening per decade in the Arctic | IPCC AR6, Chapter 9 |
| **Renewable energy capacity added (2023)** | +110 GW (solar+wind) | IEA Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment |
| **Global carbon budget remaining** | ~450 GtCO₂e to stay below 1.5 °C; ~200 GtCO₂e to stay below 2 °C | IPCC AR6, Chapter 4 |
| **Forest loss (2023)** | 12 Mt of forest area lost (~0.2 % of global forests) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Carbon sequestration by nature‑based solutions** | ~1.9 GtCO₂e per year (est.) | IPCC AR6, Chapter 7 |

### Key Take‑aways

* Global emissions have plateaued but not yet declined; the 1.5 °C target is still unattainable without rapid decarbonization.  
* Renewable energy capacity is expanding fastest in Asia and Africa, but grid integration and storage remain bottlenecks.  
* Nature‑based solutions (afforestation, soil carbon) can sequester ~2 GtCO₂e/yr, yet only 10 % of the global budget has been delivered.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

### 3.1 Science

* **Carbon Capture, Utilisation & Storage (CCUS) breakthroughs** – Commercially viable DAC plants in Iceland (Climeworks) and the U.S. (Global Thermostat) now operate at >90 % capture efficiency with integrated storage.  
* **Soil Carbon Dynamics** – Meta‑analysis published in *Nature Sustainability* (2024) shows that no-till + cover cropping can increase soil carbon by 0.3–0.8 GtCO₂e/yr globally if adopted widely.  

### 3.2 Technology

* **Solid-State Batteries** – First commercial roll‑out of high-energy-density solid-state cells for EVs in China (2024), projected to reduce battery cost by 30 % over next 5 years.  
* **Algae Biofuel** – Pilot plant in the U.S. demonstrates >1.2 L/kg lipid yield, a 25 % increase over previous benchmarks.  

### 3.3 Policy & Finance
