## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023–24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean temperature rise** (pre‑industrial baseline) | +1.88 °C (±0.04 °C) | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, 2022; NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **CO₂ atmospheric concentration** | 421 ppm (April 2024) | NOAA Earth System Research Lab |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions (GHG)** | ~36 GtCO₂e (2023) | UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2024 |
| **Net‑zero target adoption** | 140+ countries with net‑zero pledges by 2050; only 48% have legally binding targets | Climate Action Tracker, 2025 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29 % of global generation (2023) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Global wind capacity** | 1.6 TW installed (end‑2023) | Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), 2024 |
| **Solar PV capacity** | 1.05 TW installed (end‑2023) | International Energy Agency (IEA), 2024 |
| **Electric vehicle stock** | 14 million globally (mid‑2024) | EV-Volumes, 2025 |
| **Carbon price in carbon markets** | $65–$75 per ton (EU ETS 2024; Australian Carbon Pricing Scheme) | OECD Carbon Market Dashboard |

> **Key takeaway:** Global temperature is already well above the 1.5 °C threshold and rising at ~0.2 °C/decade, while emissions remain in the high‑30 GtCO₂e range—far exceeding the ~15 GtCO₂e needed to stay below 1.5 °C.
