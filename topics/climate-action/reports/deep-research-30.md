## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean temperature rise** (since pre‑industrial) | **+1.11 °C** (2023 average) | NASA GISS, NOAA (2024) |
| **Projected temperature by 2100 (RCP8.5)** | **+4.8–7.2 °C** | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2024 |
| **CO₂ atmospheric concentration** | **≈ 420 ppm** (April 2025) | NOAA ESRL |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | **~9.6 GtCO₂e** (2023) | Global Carbon Project |
| **Renewable electricity share** | **29% of total generation** (2024) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Global renewable capacity added in 2023** | **+120 GW** (mostly solar & wind) | IRENA, 2024 |
| **Net‑Zero pledges by companies** | **> 5000 entities** (including 200+ banks, insurers) | Climate Action Tracker, 2024 |
| **Global forest loss** | **≈ 12.7 million ha/yr** (2019–2023 average) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Ocean acidification rate** | **~0.1 pH units per decade** | NOAA, 2024 |

### Key Take‑aways

* The climate system is already past the 1.5 °C threshold; urgent mitigation is required to limit warming to 2 °C.
* CO₂ concentrations are climbing at ~2 ppm/yr—faster than any period in the last 800,000 years (Paleo data).
* Renewable energy penetration has accelerated, but fossil fuel consumption still dominates global emissions.
