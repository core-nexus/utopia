## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest 2023/24 data) | Source |
|-----------|----------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (1850–1900) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **Annual CO₂ emissions (atmospheric)** | 36.3 GtCO₂ (≈ 9 % of the global economy’s value) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Per‑capita CO₂ emissions** | 5.8 t CO₂ / yr (world average) – 14.2 t in USA, 1.3 t in Bangladesh | UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2024 |
| **Global renewable energy share of electricity** | 29.4 % (renewables: wind, solar, hydro, bio‑energy, geothermal) | IEA 2024 |
| **Renewable capacity addition (2023)** | +120 GW (solar 56 GW, wind 32 GW, others 32 GW) | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Global energy efficiency improvement** | 2.1 % per year (average 1990‑2023) | World Bank Energy Efficiency Review 2024 |
| **Land use for bioenergy** | 3.8 Mha (≈ 7 % of global cropland) – projected to double by 2030 | FAO Bioenergy Outlook 2024 |
| **Carbon price trend** | Average carbon price globally: $73/tonne (2023) – rising to $115/tonne in 2025 target | World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard |
| **Global investment in green tech** | $1.5 trn in 2023 (renewables, storage, CCS, EVs) – 30 % growth YoY | Climate Bonds Initiative & BloombergNEF |

### Regional Highlights

* **Europe:**  
  * EU‑27 CO₂ emissions fell 9.8 % from 2010 to 2022; still 4.5 t per capita.  
  * Net‑zero target by 2050, with 2030 intermediate goal of 55 % reduction vs 1990.

* **North America:**  
  * U.S. federal emissions fell 7.6 % from 2019 to 2023; state‑level initiatives (California, New York) lead decarbonization.  
  * Canada’s net‑zero target by 2050; recent federal carbon pricing at $80/tonne.

* **Asia-Pacific:**  
  * China: CO₂ emissions rose 2.4 % in 2023 after a 5-year decline, now ~10 t per capita.  
  * India: Emissions up 6.1 % in 2023; renewable capacity > 400 GW installed.  

* **Latin America & Caribbean:**  
  * Brazil’s deforestation rate dropped to 2.5 % of the Amazon (2023), yet still a major source of emissions.  
  * Mexico: Carbon intensity reduced by 18 % since 2010.
