## 1. Current Global Statistics and Data

| Indicator | Value (2023/24) | Trend |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** | ~36 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ | ↑ 0.5 % YoY (vs. 2022) |
| **Total greenhouse gases (CO₂‑eq)** | ~42 GtCO₂‑eq yr⁻¹ | ↑ 1.0 % YoY |
| **Global mean temperature** | +1.1 °C above pre‑industrial (1850‑1900) | Rising 0.02 °C/yr over last decade |
| **Energy‑sector CO₂ share** | 73 % of total emissions | Slight decline from 74 % in 2022 |
| **Transportation sector CO₂ share** | 14 % | ↑ 0.3 % YoY |
| **Industrial sector CO₂ share** | 21 % | ↓ 0.4 % YoY (due to electrification) |
| **Land‑use change emissions** | 2.6 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ | Stable |
| **Remaining carbon budget for ≤1.5 °C** | ~200 GtCO₂ from 2023 onward (IPCC AR6, 2023) | Exceeded by ~30 % of 2024 cumulative emissions |
| **Renewable electricity generation share** | 29 % of global power mix | ↑ 2.5 pp YoY |
| **Global renewable energy capacity added (2023)** | +90 GW (wind & solar) | Highest in history |
