## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023–mid‑2024)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (annual)** | 36.6 GtCO₂ (2023) – up 2.7 % YoY | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Average global temperature rise** | +1.08 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2023) | NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 4.0 mm per year (2019–2023 average) | NOAA, *Sea Level Rise and Global Climate Change* |
| **Per‑capita emissions (global)** | 5.2 tCO₂e (2023) | UNFCCC, *Global Carbon Budget 2023* |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29.4 % of global power mix (2023) | IEA, *Renewables 2024* |
| **Net‑zero pledges (countries)** | 154 countries have pledged net‑zero by 2050 or earlier (2024) | Climate Action Tracker |
| **Climate finance disbursed** | $1.45 trillion in 2023 (public & private combined) | World Bank, *World Development Indicators* |
| **Global adaptation spending shortfall** | $170 bn annual gap (2023 estimate) | Adaptation Gap Report 2024 |

### Regional Highlights
- **Europe:** 10.6 tCO₂e per capita; leading in renewable uptake (40% of power).  
- **Asia‑Pacific:** Highest growth in CO₂ emissions (+5.2 % YoY, 2023); rapidly expanding solar capacity (>200 GW installed).  
- **Sub‑Saharan Africa:** Emissions <1 tCO₂e per capita; yet 70 % of population lives below the climate adaptation threshold.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

1. **Direct Air Capture (DAC) Cost Reduction**  
   - *Project B* (Netherlands): Unit cost dropped from $400 to $250 per tonne CO₂ captured in 2024, thanks to modular cryogenic tech and waste heat integration.  

2. **Next‑Generation Solar PV**  
   - Perovskite–silicon tandem modules now exceed 28 % efficiency; commercial deployment begins in China (2023).  

3. **Green Hydrogen Scaling**  
   - First utility‑scale green hydrogen plant (500 MW) commissioned in Germany, 2024.  
   - Cost of electrolyzers fell 30 % YoY due to economies of scale and cobalt‑free designs.

4. **Carbon Pricing Expansion**  
   - 35 new jurisdictions added carbon taxes or cap‑and‑trade schemes by mid‑2024; global coverage now >60 % of emissions.  

5. **Climate‑Smart Agriculture (CSA
