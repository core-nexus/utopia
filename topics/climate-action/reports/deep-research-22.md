## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023–2024)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (annual)** | 36.6 GtC (≈ 41 GtCO₂e) | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Anthropogenic radiative forcing** | 2.83 W m⁻² (2023) | IPCC AR6 Working Group I |
| **Average global temperature rise above pre‑industrial** | +1.82 °C (2023) | NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis |
| **Sea‑level rise (global mean)** | 4.5 mm yr⁻¹ (2023–24 average) | NOAA/NOAA Sea Level Rise Model |
| **Arctic sea‑ice extent (June 2024)** | 2.0 million km², 22 % lower than 1981‑2010 mean | NSIDC |
| **Global renewable electricity generation share** | 29 % of total power mix (2023) | IRENA *Renewables Global Status Report 2024* |
| **Investment in climate tech (FY23)** | $73.6 bn (global, including public & private) | BloombergNEF “Green Investment” |
| **Global net‑zero pledges** | 1,000+ national targets; 150+ corporate commitments | Climate Action Tracker (CAT) |
| **Carbon budgets remaining (2 °C)** | ~420 GtC from 2023 onward | IPCC AR6 – Budget Scenarios |

### Key Takeaways
- CO₂ emissions have plateaued in the last two years but still exceed the 2 °C budget by >200 GtC.
- Renewable penetration is rising, yet fossil‑fuel capacity additions continue at ~1.5 GW yr⁻¹ (mostly gas).
- Investment in low‑carbon technologies has surged, but funding gaps persist—especially for negative‑emission solutions.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

### 3.1 Technology
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC) Commercialization** – Carbon Engineering, Climeworks now operating >2 MtCO₂ yr⁻¹ plants; cost reduced to $50–$70 t‑CO₂eq (down from $100+).  
- **Advanced Nuclear – Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)** – UK’s NuScale and US DOE’s “Advanced Reactor Demonstration” projects achieve 10 GWyr of low‑cost, low‑risk nuclear capacity.  
- **Battery Storage** – Lithium‑ion costs fell to <$30/kWh; solid‑state prototypes now in pilot phase, promising >1× energy density and 5× safety margin.  
- **Methane Leakage Mitigation** – Satellite monitoring (GHGSat) achieved real‑time detection of >90 % of high‑risk wells, enabling rapid repair.

### 3.2 Policy
- **Paris Agreement “Rule of Law” Framework** adopted by the UNFCCC (2024) to ensure transparent national reporting and accountability.  
- **EU Green Deal – Fit for 55**: Revised 2030 targets (at
