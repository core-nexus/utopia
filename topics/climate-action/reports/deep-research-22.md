## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature rise (1970–2023)** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (April 2025) | NOAA ESRL Global Monitoring Laboratory |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions (2023)** | 36.8 GtCO₂ | Global Carbon Project, 2024 |
| **Net‑zero target adoption** | 1,200+ countries/regions have pledged net‑zero by 2050 or earlier | UNFCCC Nationally Determined Contributions database |
| **Renewable electricity share (global)** | 29.3 % of total electricity generation | International Energy Agency (IEA), 2024 |
| **Global energy efficiency improvement** | 1.5 % per year (2010–2023) | IEA, 2024 |
| **Carbon intensity of global economy** | 0.35 tCO₂e per $1,000 GDP (2023) | World Bank, 2024 |
| **Deforestation rate** | 10 million ha lost annually (2019‑2023 trend) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2025 |
| **Climate finance delivered (public + private)** | $540 bn in 2023; 60 % from private sector | Climate Policy Initiative, 2024 |

**Key take‑away:**  
*Global emissions have plateaued at ~36–37 GtCO₂ in 2023 but remain far above the 1.5 °C pathway threshold.*
