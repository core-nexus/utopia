## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023–24) | Trend (2010–2024) |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** | 36.3 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ (≈ 0.2 % above 2021) | ↑ 5 % since 2010 |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (last measured in May 2024) | ↑ ~2.7 ppm/yr |
| **Average global temperature anomaly** | +1.11 °C relative to pre‑industrial (2023–24 average) | ↑ 0.18 °C per decade |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 4.9 mm yr⁻¹ (last 10 yrs) | ↑ 0.15 mm yr⁻¹ since 2010 |
| **Per‑capita emissions (high‑income)** | 11.5 tCO₂ eq | ↓ 1.3 % per annum |
| **Per‑capita emissions (low‑income)** | 1.8 tCO₂ eq | ↑ 2.9 % per annum |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28 % of global power generation (2024) | ↑ 2.6 % per year since 2010 |
| **Global forest cover loss** | 3.5 M ha yr⁻¹ (2023) | ↓ 12 % since 2010 |
| **Net‑zero pledges (countries)** | 167/195 (2024) | ↑ 20 % per year |

*Sources:* IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, World Bank Climate Data Portal, Global Carbon Project, UNFCCC National Inventory Reports, NASA Earth Observatory.

**Key take‑away:** Emissions are still rising despite net‑zero pledges. The climate system is already beyond many of the thresholds set in the Paris Agreement (e.g., 1.5 °C limit).

## 2. Key Organizations & Initiatives

| Sector | Organization / Initiative | Focus |
|--------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Governments** | UNFCCC, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) | International climate policy coordination |
| **Multilateral Development Banks** | World Bank Climate Investment Funds (CIF), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) – Green Financing | Low‑carbon infrastructure finance |
| **Private Sector** | CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) | Corporate emissions transparency & science‑based targets |
| **NGOs / Think Tanks** | Climate Action Network, 350.org, IPCC Working Groups, World Resources Institute (WRI) | Advocacy, research, public engagement |
| **Technology & Innovation Hubs** | The Climate Pledge (Amazon), Microsoft AI for Earth, Tesla Energy | Clean tech deployment, data analytics |
| **Financial Markets** | Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Fund, Green Bond Market (World Bank Group) | Capital mobilization for climate projects |
| **Academic & Research** | MIT Energy Initiative, Oxford University Climate Change Institute | Policy‑relevant research and innovation |

*Top 5 initiatives driving change (2023–24):*  
1. **Global Methane Pledge (UN)** – Target: 30 % reduction by 2030.  
2. **Net‑Zero Carbon Transition Plan (EU Green Deal, 2024)** – EU to become climate neutral by 2050.  
3. **China’s 2060 Net‑Zero Initiative** – Emissions peak before 2030.  
4. **SBTi Corporate Commitments** – >1,000 companies with science‑based targets (2024).  
5. **World Bank CIF Expansion to $20 bn in 2024** – Focus on renewable energy & nature restoration.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–24)

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2023** | **Direct Air Capture (DAC) scaling up** – New plant in Iceland (Climeworks) achieves >20 kt CO₂ captured per year, cost ↓ 30 % vs 2019. | Demonstrates viability of negative emissions at scale. |
