## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023) | Trend (2010‑2023) | Source |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** | **36.7 GtCO₂** | ↑ +10% since 2010, plateauing after 2021 spike | IPCC AR6 WG1 (2023) |
| **Anthropogenic temperature rise** | **1.09 °C above pre‑industrial** | ↑ +0.01 °C/yr in last decade | NASA GISS, NOAA 2024 |
| **Sea‑level rise** | **~3.7 mm per year** (global mean) | Accelerated by +30% after 2015 | IPCC AR6 WG1 (2023) |
| **Global renewable capacity installed (end of 2023)** | **1,300 GW** (wind: 280 GW; solar PV: 750 GW; hydro: 250 GW) | ↑ +18%/yr since 2010 | REN21 Renewables 2024 Report |
| **Global per‑capita renewable electricity share** | **28 %** | Rising fastest in EU (45 %) and China (25 %) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Carbon budget remaining (1.5 °C pathway)** | **~350 GtCO₂** (from 2010‑present emissions) | Exceeded by ~100 Gt in 2023 | IPCC AR6 WG1 (2023) |
| **Global investment in green tech (FY 2023)** | **$1.5 trillion** (energy, transport, carbon removal) | +22% vs FY 2022 | Climate Policy Initiative “Green Investment Report” 2024 |
| **Climate‑related natural disasters (2019‑2023)** | **> 1,300 events**, costing >$500 bn annually | ↑ +15% in frequency, +25% in damages | EM-DAT Global Disaster Database |

### Key Takeaways

* The world is still on a trajectory that will overshoot the 1.5 °C limit unless emissions fall by ~55 GtCO₂ per year by 2030.
* Renewable capacity has grown fast but unevenly; high‑income countries dominate absolute additions, while many LMICs lag behind in access and infrastructure.
* Green investment is expanding, yet the gap between required ($4.5–$5.5 trillion per year to meet Paris goals) and actual spend remains ~60 %.
