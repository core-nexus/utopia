## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023/24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial (1850–1900) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere** | 419 ppm (average 2023) | NOAA ESRL, 2024 |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | ~36 GtC per year (≈ 39 GtCO₂) | Global Carbon Project, 2024 |
| **Net anthropogenic heat flux** | +0.12 W/m² (2023) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Global renewable electricity capacity** | 2,600 GW installed; 43% of total generation | IRENA, 2024 |
| **Percentage of global GDP invested in green tech** | 1.8 % (approx. $5.4 trn) | World Bank, 2023 |
| **Number of countries with nationally determined contributions (NDCs)** | 197 (all UNFCCC parties) | UNFCCC, 2024 |
| **Projected global temperature by 2100 under RCP8.5** | 3.2–5.7 °C above pre‑industrial | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |

### Key Take‑aways
* The climate system is already warming beyond the Paris Agreement target of +1.5 °C.  
* CO₂ emissions have plateaued in recent years but remain high; a rapid decarbonisation pathway is required to stay below 2 °C.  
* Renewable energy capacity growth is accelerating, yet the share of renewables in global electricity generation remains below 50 %.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

### 3.1 Technological
* **Direct Air Capture (DAC)** – *Carbon Engineering* and *Climeworks* scaled up commercial DAC units, achieving first profitable operation in the U.S. (2024).  
* **Solid‑state batteries** – *QuantumScape* demonstrated a 100 kWh battery with >400 cycles (2023), promising for grid storage.  
* **Perovskite solar cells** – Achieved 25% efficiency and >10-year stability in commercial modules (2024).  

### 3.2 Policy & Finance
* **EU “Fit for 55” package** – Introduced a new ETS covering aviation, expanded the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) to all sectors by 2030.  
* **China’s Green Credit Guidelines (2024)** – Mandates green financing criteria for banks; first year disbursed $120 bn in green loans.  
* **Net‑Zero Pathways** – The World Economic Forum released the “Climate Action Tracker” tool, enabling companies to benchmark their decarbonisation progress (updated 2024).  

### 3.3 Nature & Adaptation
* **Blue Carbon Restoration** – Global pilot program restored 1 million hectares of mangroves,
