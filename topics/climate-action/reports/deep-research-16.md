## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | ~36 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ (2023) | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Average global temperature rise** | +1.2 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2023) | IPCC, *AR6 Climate Change 2023* |
| **Sea‑level rise rate** | ~4.7 mm yr⁻¹ (1993–2023) | NOAA, *Sea Level Trends* |
| **Per‑capita CO₂ emissions** | 5.2 tCO₂ per person (global average, 2023) | Global Carbon Project |
| **Renewable electricity share of global power mix** | 28 % (2024) | REN21, *Renewables Global Status Report* |
| **Global carbon budget to stay below 1.5 °C** | <420 GtCO₂ remaining (as of 2023) | IPCC, *AR6* |
| **Investment in low‑carbon technologies (FY 2024)** | $2.7 trn (global renewable & energy storage) | BloombergNEF, *Global Energy Transition Index 2025* |

**Key take‑aways**

1. Global emissions have plateaued since 2019 but remain far above the Paris Agreement limits.
2. Renewable electricity is growing fastest, yet fossil fuel use in transport and industry still dominates.
3. The carbon budget for a 1.5 °C trajectory is shrinking rapidly; urgent emission cuts are required.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

### 3.1 Technology
- **Perovskite Solar Cells**: Commercial pilot plants in Germany achieving >25 % efficiency and 15 % lower cost than silicon (Nature Energy, 2023).
- **Solid‑State Batteries**: Nissan & Toyota released prototype high‑energy-density batteries for EVs with 30 % higher safety profile (Electrochemistry Journal, 2024).
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC)**: Carbon Engineering scaled up its DAC plant in Utah to 1 MtCO₂/yr capacity, reducing cost from $500 to $250 per ton CO₂ (MIT Technology Review, 2023).

### 3.2 Policy
- **EU Green Deal Revisions**: EU introduced the *Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism* (CBAM) phased in 2026 to level the playing field for imported goods.
- **U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)**: $369 billion in climate incentives, including tax credits for EVs and renewable projects (Congressional Budget Office, 2023).

### 3.3 Finance
- **Green New Deal Fund**: $500 bn allocated by the European Investment Bank to support low‑carbon transition in SMEs (EIB Annual Report 2024).
- **Carbon Pricing Expansion**: 30 new jurisdictions adopted carbon taxes or cap‑and‑trade schemes, covering
