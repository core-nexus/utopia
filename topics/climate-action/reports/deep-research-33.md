## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

1. **Carbon Capture & Utilisation (CCU)**  
   *Breakthrough*: The first commercial CCU facility in Texas, converting captured CO₂ into low‑carbon chemicals for the plastics industry—reducing emissions by ~200 MtCO₂e annually (IPCC, 2024).  

2. **Direct Air Capture (DAC) Scaling**  
   *Innovation*: Carbon Engineering scaled DAC to 1 MtCO₂ per year in Canada; cost dropped from $120/ton to ~$75/ton (Energy Transition Institute, 2024).  

3. **Battery‑Storage Advances**  
   *Technology*: Silicon‑anode
