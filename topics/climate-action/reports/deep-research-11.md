## 1. Current Global Statistics and Data

| Metric | 2023 Value | Trend (2010‑2023) | Source |
|--------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| **CO₂ emissions** | 36.4 Gt CO₂e | ↑10 % from 2022; +50 % vs 1990 | [IEA, *World Energy Outlook* 2024] |
| **Global mean temperature** | +1.11 °C above pre‑industrial | +0.03 °C/year (2019‑23) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **Renewable share of electricity generation** | 29.2 % | ↑5 pp vs 2022 | IEA, *Renewables 2024* |
| **Net‑zero pledges (corporate)** | 1,600+ entities | +20 % YoY | CDP Net Zero Tracker 2024 |
| **Annual climate finance** | $1.3 trillion (2023) | ↑5 % vs 2022 | Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) 2024 |
| **Extreme weather events** | 48 major disasters (UNISDR, 2024) | ↑15 % per decade | UNISDR EM-DAT |

### Key Highlights

- The **energy sector** remains the largest emitter (~75 % of global CO₂), followed by **agriculture & land use** (~12 %) and **industry** (~9 %).
- **Methane** emissions have grown 6 % in 2023, largely from livestock and natural gas leaks.
- **Deforestation** slowed slightly (1.2 Mt/yr of forest loss 2023) but still exceeds reforestation rates.
