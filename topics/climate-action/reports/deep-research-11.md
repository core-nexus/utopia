## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value | Source |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature rise** (since pre‑industrial) | +1.11 °C (2023 average) | NASA GISS; NOAA Climate.gov |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (May 2024) | NOAA ESRL / Mauna Loa |
| **Annual global greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂eq)** | ~59 Gt CO₂eq (2022) | IPCC AR6, WRI GHG Protocol |
| **Renewable energy share of total electricity generation** | 29.3 % (2023) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Global renewable capacity added in 2023** | +140 GW (solar: 73 GW; wind: 55 GW; hydro: 12 GW) | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Carbon‑neutral pledges by nations** | 191 of 193 UN member states have NDCs; 139 set net‑zero targets by 2050 or earlier | UNFCCC COP28 (2023) |
| **Global forest loss** | 10.5 m ha per year (2019–2023) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Ocean acidification (pH change)** | ~0.1 units decrease since 1950 | NOAA Ocean Acidification Program |
| **Extreme weather events (≥$1B losses)** | 28 events in 2023, cumulative $62 bn loss | EM-DAT |
| **Climate‑related migration** | Estimated 115 million climate refugees by 2050 | UN-Habitat, World Bank |

> **Key Takeaway:** Global warming has surpassed the 1.5 °C threshold with clear evidence of accelerating CO₂ emissions and a growing reliance on fossil fuels despite expanding renewable capacity.
