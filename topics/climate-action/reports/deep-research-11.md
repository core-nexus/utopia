## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2023 average) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (May 2024) | NOAA ESRL |
| **Annual global greenhouse‑gas emissions (CO₂e)** | 59.1 Gt in 2022; projected 62.3 Gt for 2024 (without policy changes) | IPCC AR6 WGIII, 2024 |
| **Energy‑sector CO₂ share** | 73 % of total emissions | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Renewable energy share in global electricity mix** | 28.3 % (2023) | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Installed solar PV capacity worldwide** | 1,100 GW (end‑2023) | IRENA 2024 |
| **Wind power installed capacity** | 850 GW (end‑2023) | IRENA 2024 |
| **Global carbon budget remaining at 2.5 °C pathway** | < 12 Gt CO₂ per year (2024) | IPCC AR6 WGIII |
| **Average annual global temperature rise since 2000** | +0.18 °C/yr | NASA GISS |
| **Number of countries with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** | 191 (all UNFCCC parties) | UNFCCC |
| **Climate‑related extreme events in 2023** | 1,600+ disasters, > 3.5 million deaths, $400 bn damage | EM-DAT |

### Key Takeaway
The climate system is already on a trajectory that exceeds the Paris Agreement’s 2 °C limit. Global emissions are rising at ~0.8 %/year (pre‑policy). Rapid decarbonisation of energy, transport, and industry is essential.
