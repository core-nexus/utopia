## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature rise (pre‑industrial)** | +1.09 °C (2023 average) | NASA GISS, 2024 Climate Change: Global Temperature Report |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (April 2025) | NOAA ESRL, CO₂ Monthly Mean |
| **Projected cumulative emissions needed to keep warming <2 °C** | ~1.3 GtCO₂e by 2030; net zero by 2050 | IPCC AR6, Synthesis Report |
| **Renewable electricity share (global)** | 29 % of total generation (2023) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Global energy‑related CO₂ emissions** | 36.8 GtCO₂e (2022) – up 0.5 % YoY | UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2024 |
| **Annual investment in clean tech & green infrastructure (2023)** | $1.7 trillion | World Bank, Global Climate Finance Tracker |
| **Global forest loss** | 10.8 M ha/year (2019‑2023 average) | FAO Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Average annual per‑capita carbon budget remaining (≤2 °C)** | ~12 tCO₂e | IPCC AR6, Budget Calculator |

### Key Take‑aways
- Global temperature is already above the 1.5 °C threshold set by the Paris Agreement.
- CO₂ concentrations have surpassed historic highs; atmospheric accumulation continues at ~3–4 ppm/year.
- Renewable share of electricity has grown but still below the 2030 target of 50 % (IEA).
- Clean‑tech investment is increasing, yet it falls short of the $10 trillion needed annually by 2030.
