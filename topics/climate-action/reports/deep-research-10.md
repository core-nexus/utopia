## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023–24) | Trend (2010‑2024) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** | 36.6 GtCO₂e (≈ 5 % above 2022) | ↑ 1.8 %/yr | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (average 2023) | ↑ ~2.0 ppm/yr | NOAA ESRL |
| **Annual temperature anomaly** | +1.11 °C vs pre‑industrial | ↑ 0.01 °C/yr | NASA GISS, 2024 update |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 3.6 mm/yr (2019–2023) | ↑ ~10 % faster since 2000 | IPCC AR6 WG1 |
| **Global renewable share of electricity generation** | 29 % (2023) | ↑ +4 pp/yr | REN21, *Renewables Global Status Report* 2024 |
| **Carbon‑neutral pledges (Net‑Zero)** | 145 countries & 12 major companies | ↑ ~15 % per year | Climate Action Tracker |
| **Global climate finance flows** | $1.2 trillion (2023) | ↑ +10 %/yr | UNEP FI, *Climate Finance Report* 2024 |

### Key Take‑aways
- CO₂ emissions continue to rise despite net‑zero pledges; the gap between pledges and action remains ~5–7 GtCO₂e per year.
- Temperature anomaly is approaching the 1.5 °C threshold; urgent mitigation needed by 2030.
- Renewable energy penetration has accelerated, but fossil fuel subsidies still exceed $700 billion annually (IEA).

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

1. **Direct Air Capture (DAC) Scaling**  
   - *Climeworks* and *Carbon Engineering* launched commercial DAC plants in Iceland and the U.S., capturing ~10 ktCO₂/yr each, with projected cost declines to $100–$150/tCO₂ by 2030.

2. **Green Hydrogen Milestone**  
   - The EU’s *Hydrogen Strategy* achieved the first fully electrolyzed hydrogen plant (40 MW) in Spain, demonstrating cost parity with natural gas for heavy industry.  
   - *Source:* European Commission, *Hydrogen Roadmap Europe* 2024.

3. **Carbon Pricing Expansion**  
   - 28 new jurisdictions adopted carbon taxes or expanded existing ones, raising the global average price to $78/tCO₂ in 2024 (up from $56 in 2022).  
   - *Source:* World Bank “Carbon Pricing Dashboard” 2025 Update.

4. **Climate‑Resilient Infrastructure**  
   - The U.S. Department
