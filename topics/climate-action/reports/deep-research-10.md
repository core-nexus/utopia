## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023–mid‑2024)

| Indicator | Value (2023/24) | Trend / Comment |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** | 36.7 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ | ↑1.8 % vs 2022; still ~2 % below the Paris‑aligned 2030 target of 35 GtCO₂ (IEA, 2024). |
| **Net anthropogenic radiative forcing** | 3.12 W m⁻² (IPCC AR6) | Highest in recorded history; 0.7 W m⁻² above pre‑industrial baseline. |
| **Temperature anomaly** | +1.11 °C vs 1850–1900 average (NOAA, 2024) | 30 % chance of surpassing the 1.5 °C threshold by 2030 if current trends continue. |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 3.3 mm yr⁻¹ (IPCC AR6) | Accelerating; projected +0.7–1.2 m by 2100 under RCP8.5. |
| **Renewable share of global electricity generation** | 29.9 % (IEA, 2024) | ↑5 pp since 2019; still below the 45 % target for 2030. |
| **Global solar PV capacity** | 1.2 TW (statista.com, 2024) | +15 GW monthly in Q3‑24; cumulative growth 70 % YoY. |
| **Global wind power capacity** | 860 GW (IEA, 2024) | +30 GW in Q2‑24; 13 % of total electricity generation. |
| **Carbon intensity of global GDP** | 0.25 tCO₂ per $1,000 USD (World Bank, 2023) | Declining 2.5 % YoY but still above the 0.15 tCO₂/$1,000 target for 2030. |
| **Methane emissions from agriculture** | 9.8 MtCH₄ yr⁻¹ (UNEP, 2024) | ↑3 % vs 2022; major contributor to short‑lived climate pollutants. |
