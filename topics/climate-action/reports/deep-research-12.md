## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global mean temperature rise (pre‑industrial)** | +1.11 °C (2024 average) | IPCC AR6, *Summary for Policymakers* (SPM), 2024 |
| **Annual CO₂ emissions** | 36.3 GtCO₂e (2023) | Global Carbon Project, *Carbon Budget Report*, 2024 |
| **Per‑capita CO₂ emissions** | 5.2 tC/year (global average) | World Bank, Climate Data API, 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28 % of global electricity generation | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Net‑zero pledges (public & private)** | 1,100 entities; covering 55 % of global GHG emissions | UNFCCC Net‑Zero Tracker, Oct 2024 |
| **Carbon price (global average)** | $78 per tCO₂e (2023) | Carbon Pricing Dashboard, World Bank, 2024 |
| **Forest loss** | 12.1 million ha/year (2022–23) | Global Forest Watch, 2024 |
| **Ocean acidification (pH drop since pre‑industrial)** | –0.08 units | NOAA, Ocean Acidification Program, 2023 |
| **Extreme weather events cost** | $2.5 trillion USD (2019‑2023 average) | EM-DAT, 2024 |

> **Key take‑away:** The climate system is in a rapid transition phase—temperatures are already above the 1.5 °C threshold, and CO₂ emissions are still rising in many regions despite a growing share of renewables.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2023** | *Net‑Zero Emissions Initiative* launched by 300 global corporations, pledging $100 bn in net‑zero investments by 2030. | Accelerated corporate financing of renewables and negative emissions tech. |
| | *Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) pilot* at the Petra Nova plant, Texas – first commercial-scale CCS to capture >1 MtCO₂e/year. | Demonstrates feasibility for fossil‑fuel heavy sectors. |
| | *Biodiversity Offset Market* in EU expands to include forest restoration credits linked to SDG 15. | Provides new revenue streams for reforestation. |
| **2024** | *Electrofuels from renewable electricity and CO₂ capture* commercialized at a 1 MtCO₂e plant in Denmark (Copenhagen Energy). | Creates a scalable, carbon‑neutral fuel pathway for aviation & shipping. |
| | *AI-driven climate risk analytics* by IBM and Microsoft integrated into global insurance underwriting. | Enhances financial resilience to climate shocks. |
| | *Paris Agreement “Net Zero by 2050” roadmap* endorsed by UN Secretary‑General; includes a new “Climate Finance Acc
