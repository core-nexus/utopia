## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean temperature rise** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial (2024 average) | IPCC *AR6* (2023) |
| **Annual CO₂ emissions (CO₂eq)** | 36.8 GtC yr⁻¹ (2023) | Global Carbon Project, 2024 update |
| **Sectoral emissions** | • Transport: 14 % <br>• Energy: 33 % <br>• Industry: 21 % <br>• Agriculture & land‑use change: 24 % | IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050, 2024 |
| **Renewable energy share of global electricity** | 28.3 % (2023) | IRENA 2024 Global Energy Report |
| **Global investment in clean tech (FY23)** | $1.5 trillion (energy + transport + buildings) | BloombergNEF, 2024 |
| **Carbon budget remaining for 2 °C** | ~400 GtC (as of 2023) | IPCC *AR6* |
| **Global forest loss** | 10.7 Mt ha yr⁻¹ (2019‑23 average) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Sea‑level rise rate** | 3.3 mm yr⁻¹ (last decade) | NOAA, 2024 |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Emissions are still rising** – the world is on track for ~2.8 °C by 2100 without drastic cuts.
2. **Renewables are growing fastest**, but fossil‑fuel infrastructure investment outpaces clean‑tech spending.
3. **Carbon budgets are shrinking**; only ~400 GtC of CO₂ can still be emitted to stay below 2 °C.
