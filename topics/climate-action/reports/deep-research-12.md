## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (annual)** | 36.6 GtCO₂ (2023) – up 2.5 % YoY | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Anthropogenic GHGs (CO₂eq)** | 50.8 GtCO₂eq (2023) – 1.9 % YoY | UNFCCC, *Global Stocktake 2023* |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 420 ppm (Jan 2025) – +1.4 ppm/month | NOAA ESRL |
| **Average global temperature anomaly** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial (2024) | NASA GISS |
| **Sea‑level rise rate** | 3.2 mm/yr (2019–2023 average) | IPCC, *AR6* |
| **Global renewable electricity share** | 29 % of total generation (2023) – +1.5 pp YoY | IRENA, *Renewables Global Status Report 2024* |
| **Net‑zero pledges (countries)** | 134 countries pledged by Dec 2024 | UNFCCC Net‑Zero Tracker |
| **Global forest loss** | 12.3 Mt of tree cover lost in 2023 – 2.1 % YoY | Global Forest Watch |
| **Climate finance delivered** | $650 bn (2023) – 5 % below the $700 bn pledge | Climate Policy Initiative, *Finance Tracker* |

> **Key Takeaway:**  
> The planet is still on a warming trajectory; emissions are growing faster than the pace of decarbonization. However, renewable penetration and net‑zero pledges have accelerated in recent years.
