## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Global Value (latest available) | Trend (2019‑2024) |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (Oct 2024, NOAA) | ↑ 2.5 ppm / yr |
| **Annual global temperature anomaly** | +1.11 °C vs pre‑industrial (IPCC 6th Assessment) | Steady increase, with 2023 the 8th warmest year on record |
| **Net anthropogenic CO₂ emissions** | 36 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ (IEA 2024) | ↑ 2%/yr since 2019 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28.4 % of global power mix (IRENA 2024) | ↑ 1.8 %/yr |
| **Carbon intensity of electricity** | 450 gCO₂/kWh (IEA 2024) | ↓ 3.2%/yr |
| **Global net‑zero pledges (country level)** | 146 countries, 93 % of global GDP pledged by 2050 (Climate Action Tracker 2025) | Rapid acceleration post‑COP28 |
| **Investment in low‑carbon technologies** | $2.6 trillion 2024 (GSMA, World Bank) | ↑ 7%/yr |
| **Forest cover loss** | 10.3 m ha yr⁻¹ (FAO 2024) | Stabilizing in high‑income countries, rising in LMICs |

*Key take‑away:* The climate system is already beyond many 1.5 °C thresholds. Emission trajectories remain on a warming path unless rapid decarbonisation and negative emissions are deployed at scale.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

### 3.1 Energy Transition

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **$500 billion EU “Fit for 55” package** | Drives electrification, hydrogen, carbon pricing in Europe |
| **US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – Clean Energy Credits** | $73 bn available for renewable projects; stimulates solar & wind deployment |
| **Breakthroughs in photovoltaic efficiency** | 26.5% lab‑scale modules (2024, Jena University); commercial adoption expected 2026 |

### 3.2 Negative Emissions

| Technology | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Direct Air Capture (DAC)** | Operational plants: Climeworks (Switzerland), Carbon Engineering (Canada) – combined capacity 1 MtCO₂/yr; cost falling to $50–$80/t CO₂ by 2026 |
| **Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)** | Pilot in Australia’s Green Energy Transition Hub – 10 MtCO₂/yr potential by 2035 |
