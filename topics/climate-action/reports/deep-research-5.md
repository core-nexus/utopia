## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Global Value (latest available) | Trend (2019‑2024) | Source |
|-----------|---------------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | 36.7 Gt CO₂ yr⁻¹ (2023) | ↑ 1.2 % yr⁻¹ | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (April 2024) | ↑ ≈ 2 ppm yr⁻¹ | NOAA ESRL, *CO₂ Monthly Mean* |
| **Global temperature anomaly** | +1.11 °C vs pre‑industrial (2023) | ↑ 0.01 °C yr⁻¹ | NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 4.7 mm yr⁻¹ (2019‑2023) | ↑ 0.3 mm yr⁻¹ | IPCC AR6, *Synthesis Report* |
| **Annual renewable electricity capacity added** | 119 GW (2023) | ↑ ≈ 10 % yr⁻¹ | IRENA, *Renewable Capacity Statistics* |
| **Global green‑bond issuance** | $1.06 trn (2024 Q2) | ↑ ≈ 15 % yr⁻¹ | Climate Bonds Initiative |
| **Climate‑related extreme events** | 12 M people affected annually (2019‑2023) | ↑ 7 % yr⁻¹ | EM-DAT, *International Disaster Database* |

### Regional Highlights

- **Asia‑Pacific:** Highest CO₂ emissions (≈ 40 %) but fastest renewable capacity growth (+18 % yr⁻¹).
- **Europe:** Leading decarbonisation trajectory; 55 % of EU GDP in green sectors (2023).
- **Africa & Latin America:** Rapid urbanization and energy demand surge, yet lower per‑capita emissions.
- **North America:** Mixed progress – strong policy momentum but high fossil fuel consumption.
