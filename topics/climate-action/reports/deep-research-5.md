## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2024)

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature rise since pre‑industrial (1850–1900)** | +1.09 °C (±0.02 °C) | NASA GISS, 2023 update |
| **Annual CO₂ emissions** | ~41 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ (2022) – up 0.6 % YoY | Global Carbon Project, 2024 |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 420 ppm (June 2024) | NOAA ESRL |
| **Annual methane flux to atmosphere** | ~5 GtCH₄ yr⁻¹ | WMO/UNEP Climate Change Report 2023 |
| **Global renewable energy share of electricity generation** | 29.7 % (2023) – up 1.8 pp from 2019 | IEA, World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Net‑zero pledges by national governments** | 112 countries (including EU, US, China, India, Japan) | UNFCCC, Paris Agreement status 2024 |
| **Global carbon budget remaining at 1.5 °C pathway** | ~400 GtCO₂ (as of 2023) – 30 % used by 2024 | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, 2022 |
| **Energy‑related CO₂ emissions share** | 73 % of total global greenhouse gas emissions | UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2023 |
| **Climate‑finance flows (public + private)** | $1.5 trillion in 2023 – 14 % increase YoY | Climate Policy Initiative, 2024 |

### Key Takeaways
* Global temperature is approaching the critical 1.5 °C threshold for the most severe climate impacts.
* CO₂ emissions are still rising despite a modest shift toward renewables; fossil‑fuel consumption remains high in many emerging economies.
* Carbon budgets are being consumed rapidly – only ~400 GtCO₂ left to stay within the 1.5 °C pathway, yet emissions continue at ~41 GtCO₂/yr.
