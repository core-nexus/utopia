## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023‑24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature rise** | +1.10 °C above pre‑industrial levels (1850–1900) | NASA GISS, 2024 Climate Report |
| **Annual CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | 36.5 GtCO₂ per year | Global Carbon Project, 2023 |
| **Projected 2050 temperature scenario** (if current trends continue) | +2.8 °C | IPCC AR6 WG1 “Synthesis Report” |
| **Renewable electricity share (global)** | 29% of total electricity generation | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Global solar PV capacity added in 2023** | 136 GW (cumulative > 1.5 TW) | IRENA, 2024 |
| **Annual methane emissions from agriculture** | 45 MtCH₄ | FAO, 2023 |
| **Number of countries with net‑zero pledges by 2050** | 150+ | Climate Action Tracker (CAT), 2024 |
| **Global climate finance flows to developing countries (2022)** | $54.5 bn in grants + concessional loans | OECD DAC, 2023 |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Temperature trajectory is on a “dangerous” path** – without drastic emissions cuts, the world could exceed 2 °C by mid‑century.
2. **Renewables are growing fast but still lag behind fossil fuel expansion in certain regions** (e.g., Africa’s electricity access gap).
3. **Climate finance is rising but remains below the $100 bn annual target set by the Paris Agreement for developing nations.**
4. **Sectoral emissions:** Energy 73%, Industry 21%, Transport 12% (World Bank, 2023). Agriculture and land‑use change account for ~10%.
