## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature rise** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2024 average) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions (2023)** | 36.6 GtCO₂e | Global Carbon Project, 2024 update |
| **CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere** | 421 ppm (2024) | NOAA ESRL |
| **Average global sea‑level rise (2000–2023)** | 3.2 mm/yr | IPCC AR6 WG1 |
| **Projected temperature by 2100 under RCP 8.5** | +4.8 °C (median) | IPCC AR6 |
| **Renewable electricity share (global, 2023)** | 27% of total generation | IRENA 2024 report |
| **Global net‑zero pledges (as of Sept 2024)** | 122 countries, 19 multinationals | Climate Action Tracker |
| **Carbon budget to stay below 1.5 °C** | ~350–450 GtCO₂e remaining (2024) | IPCC AR6 |
| **Climate‑related extreme weather events (2019‑2023)** | 12 % increase in frequency, $2.8 trn damage | EM-DAT |

*Key take‑away:* The planet is already on a trajectory that will exceed the 1.5 °C limit unless emissions are cut by >45 % from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero by ~2050.
