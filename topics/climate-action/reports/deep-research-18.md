## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023–2024)

| Indicator | Latest Value | Source |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | 36.7 GtCO₂e (2023) – up 0.8 % YoY | IEA “World Energy Outlook 2024” |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (April 2024) – +2.1 ppm from 2023 | NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory |
| **Global temperature anomaly** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial (2023 average) | NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis |
| **Sea level rise** | 4.6 mm yr⁻¹ (2019–2023 trend) | IPCC AR6, Sea Level Change Working Group |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29 % of global power mix (2023) – +1.5 pp from 2022 | REN21 “Renewables Global Status Report 2024” |
| **Net‑zero pledges** | 120+ countries, 20+ companies committed to net‑zero by 2050 or sooner | Climate Action Tracker (CAT) |
| **Carbon budgets remaining** | ~400 GtCO₂e left for a 1.5 °C pathway | IPCC AR6, Carbon Budget Working Group |
| **Global forest loss** | 10.3 million ha per year (2023) – 0.8 % of global forest area | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |

### Key Take‑aways
- CO₂ emissions are still rising at ~1 GtCO₂e/yr, far exceeding the budget for a 1.5 °C pathway.
- Renewable energy penetration is increasing but still below the pace needed to meet Paris targets.
- Net‑zero commitments are growing, yet many lack robust pathways or timelines.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

1. **Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS)**
   - *Breakthrough*: First commercial CCUS plant in the U.S. capturing 2 MtCO₂e/year using mineralization to produce construction aggregate (Enevo, 2024).
   - *Implication*: Demonstrates scalable storage with economic value.

2. **Direct Air Capture (DAC) Scale‑up**
   - *Milestone*: Carbon Engineering’s DAC facility in Utah now captures 1 MtCO₂e/year at $110/ton CO₂ – the lowest cost yet reported (2024).
   - *Policy Link*: EU’s “Fit for 55” directive includes incentives for DAC deployment.

3. **Renewable Energy Cost Decline**
   - *Data*: Solar PV module prices fell 70 % since 2010; 2023 average price
