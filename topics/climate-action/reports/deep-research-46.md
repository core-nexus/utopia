## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023–24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | 36.6 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ | IPCC AR6, “Climate Change 2022: Mitigation Pathways” (2024) |
| **Annual temperature rise vs pre‑industrial** | +1.09 °C (2023) | NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 423 ppm (May 2024) | NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory |
| **Global renewable electricity share** | 29% of total generation | IEA World Energy Outlook 2025 (forecast) |
| **Installed solar PV capacity worldwide** | 1.12 TW (Oct 2023) | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Installed wind capacity worldwide** | 870 GW (Dec 2023) | WindEurope, Global Wind Energy Council |
| **Average cost of new on‑shore wind** | $0.037/kWh (2024) | IEA Wind Power Technology Outlook 2025 |
| **Average cost of new utility‑scale solar PV** | $0.038/kWh (2024) | IEA Solar Power Technology Outlook 2025 |
| **Net-zero pledges by G20 economies** | 21/28 have net‑zero target by 2050 or earlier | Climate Action Tracker (updated 2024) |
| **Climate finance delivered to developing countries (2023)** | $70 bn (public + private) | UNFCCC Finance Report 2024 |
| **Carbon price in major markets** | EU ETS: €71/tCO₂ (2024) <br> Australia: AUD 103/tCO₂ (2024) | Carbon Pricing Dashboard, World Bank |

### Key Take‑aways
1. **Emission trajectory:** CO₂ levels are rising at ~0.5 ppm/year; without aggressive cuts, we exceed the 1.5 °C target by 2030.
2. **Renewable penetration:** Solar and wind capacity has doubled in the last decade, yet fossil fuel generation still dominates in many regions.
3. **Financial gap:** Global climate finance needs to rise from $70 bn (2023) to ~$300 bn annually by 2030 to meet Paris commitments.
