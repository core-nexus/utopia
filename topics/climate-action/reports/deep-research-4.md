## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** | 36.6 GtCO₂ (2023, UNFCCC) | UNFCCC Emissions Gap Report 2024 |
| **Annual temperature increase** | +1.12 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2023, NOAA) | NOAA Global Temperature Dataset |
| **Global mean sea level rise** | 4.8 mm/yr (2019‑2023 average) | IPCC AR6 WG1 |
| **Deforestation rate** | 10.5 Mt of forest loss per year (2023, FAO) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28.2 % of global electricity generation (2023, IEA) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Net‑zero pledges** | 1,350+ national net‑zero commitments by 2050 (2024, Climate Action Tracker) | Climate Action Tracker |
| **Climate finance delivered** | $620 bn in public climate finance (2023, UNFCCC Finance Tracking Dashboard) | UNFCCC |
| **Private sector investment in clean tech** | $2.1 trn in 2023 (global, BloombergNEF) | BloombergNEF Power Transition 2024 |

### Key Take‑aways
- CO₂ emissions have plateaued at ~36 GtCO₂ but remain 55 % above the 2019 level; a 50 % reduction by 2030 is still required to stay below 1.5 °C.
- Renewable energy penetration has increased by ~4 % per year, yet global electricity demand continues to grow ~2.7 % annually (IEA).
- Climate finance gaps are widening: the 2023 “Green Climate Fund” disbursement was only $3.6 bn of an $8.5 bn requested target.

| **International Bodies** | UNFCCC, IPCC, WMO | Global policy coordination | IPCC AR6 synthesis released 2024; UNFCCC COP29 commitments updated. |
| **Multilateral Funds** | Green Climate Fund (GCF), Global Environment Facility (GEF) | Finance for developing countries | GCF disbursed $3.8 bn in 2023, a 30 % increase over 2022. |
| **Public‑Private Partnerships** | World Economic Forum – Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) | Trade & carbon pricing | CBAM framework adopted by EU; pilot for steel sector launched 2024. |
| **Technology Platforms** | Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) | Knowledge sharing | IRENA’s “Renewable Power Generation Costs” report showed a 30 % cost decline in solar PV. |
| **NGO Coalitions** | Climate Action Network, Global Climate Council | Advocacy & science communication | CAAN launched “Carbon Footprint Calculator for SMEs” (2024). |
| **Regional Hubs** | African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) | Regional financing | AREI secured $2.5 bn in 2023 to build solar farms in East Africa. |

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

| Area | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Carbon Capture** | Direct Air Capture (DAC) scaling: Climeworks and Carbon Engineering reached cumulative capture of 1 MtCO₂ in 2024, with cost dropping to $100/tonne. | Feasibility for negative emissions at scale. |
| **Battery Storage** | Solid‑state battery prototypes achieving >300 Wh/kg energy density (QuantumScape, 2023). | Potential to triple grid storage capacity by 2035. |
| **Hydrogen Economy** | Green hydrogen production cost fell to $2.50/kg in the EU (IEA, 2024) and
