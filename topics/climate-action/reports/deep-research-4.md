## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial (1850‑1900) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (average 2023) | NOAA ESRL, 2024 |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | 36.6 GtC/year (≈ 134 GtCO₂) | Global Carbon Project, 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28% of total electricity generation | IEA World Energy Outlook 2025 |
| **Global forest area loss** | 10 Mt ha/yr (≈ 1.2 %) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2023 |
| **Carbon‑neutral commitments** | 122 countries, 9 multilateral agreements in force | UNFCCC, 2024 |
| **Net‑zero transition cost estimate** | $50–$70 trillion (global GDP) by 2050 | World Economic Forum, 2024 |

### Regional Highlights

* **Europe** – EU net‑zero target 2050; 45% renewable share of electricity in 2023.  
* **Asia‑Pacific** – China: 26% renewables (2023), but coal consumption still >70 % of energy mix. India: 42% renewable share, yet projected to add 100 GW coal by 2030 if policy inertia continues.  
* **Africa** – 4% electrification; solar PV installed capacity grew 28% in 2023 (UNDP).

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑24)

1. **Carbon Capture, Utilization & Storage (CCUS)**
   * First commercial-scale CCUS plant in the U.S. (Noble Energy, 2024) – 2 MtCO₂/yr capture.
   * EU “BECCS” pilot project (Netherlands, 2023) – 0.5 MtCO₂ sequestered per year.

2. **Direct Air Capture (DAC)**
   * Carbon Engineering scaled up its DAC facility in Canada to 500 tCO₂/yr by Q1 2024.
   * New modular DAC units (Climeworks, 2023) – cost < $120/tCO₂.

3. **Renewable Energy Cost Reductions**
   * Global Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for solar PV fell to $0.04/kWh in 2023 (IEA).
   * Offshore wind LCOE dropped below $0.07/kWh globally, a 30% reduction from 2019.

4. **Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)**
   * First utility‑scale lithium‑sulfur battery plant commissioned in China (2024), 1 GWh capacity.
   * Grid‑scale flow batteries now operating at >90 % round‑trip efficiency in Germany (2023).

5. **Climate‑Smart
