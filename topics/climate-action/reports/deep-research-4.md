|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Global average temperature rise** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial baseline (IPCC 6th Assessment, 2024) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2024 |
| **CO₂ atmospheric concentration** | 421 ppm (Feb 2025) | NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | 36.3 GtC/yr (2023 estimate) | BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2024 |
| **Energy‑sector share of emissions** | 73% of total, with electricity & heat at 27% | IEA Emissions Dashboard 2024 |
| **Renewable energy capacity added in 2023** | 1.5 GW (solar), 0.8 GW (wind) – 20% global share | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Global forest loss** | 10.2 million ha/year (2019–24 trend) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2023 |

### Regional Highlights  

* **Europe** – 32% of global emissions; EU net‑zero target 2050 with 2030 interim: 55% reduction from 1990 levels.  
* **Asia‑Pacific** – >50% of world’s energy demand, but solar PV installations grew 30% in 2023.  
* **Sub‑Saharan Africa** – Energy access at 58%; solar home systems increased by 4 million units (2023).

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–24)

1. **Direct Air Capture (DAC) Scaling**  
   * Carbon Clean’s first commercial DAC facility in Germany captures ~10 kt CO₂/yr at $120/tonne, a 40% cost reduction from 2022 benchmarks.*

2. **Green Hydrogen Commercialization**  
   * The EU’s “Hydrogen Strategy” launched 30 pilot projects (total 0.5 GW electrolyzer capacity) in 2023; cost of green H₂ fell to $4–6/kg in 2024.*
