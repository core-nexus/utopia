## 1. Current Global Statistics and Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023‑24) | Trend (2010‑2024) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **CO₂ emissions** | 36 GtCO₂ per year (global, 2023 estimate) | ↑ 1.7 %/yr since 2010 | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024; UNFCCC Emissions Gap Report |
| **Non‑CO₂ greenhouse gases** | 20 GtCO₂eq per year | ↑ 2.5 %/yr | IPCC AR6 WG1 |
| **Global mean temperature rise** | +1.9 °C above pre‑industrial (2024) | +0.02 °C/yr | NASA GISS, NOAA ESRL |
| **Sectoral emissions** | • Energy: 73 %<br>• Transport: 14 %<br>• Industry: 10 %<br>• Agriculture & land‑use: 12 % | Energy share stable; transport & industry declining slightly | IEA, World Bank GHG Inventory |
| **Extreme weather events** | 1.2 M people affected by climate‑related disasters in 2023 (UNISDR) | ↑ 15 %/yr | EM-DAT |
| **Climate finance flows** | $517 bn pledged to developing countries (2024) | +12 %/yr | Climate Action Tracker, UNFCCC Finance Report |
| **Carbon budget remaining (1.5 °C)** | ~400 GtCO₂ (as of 2023) | Depleted 90 % in last decade | IPCC AR6 |
| **Adaptation need** | $550 bn/year by 2030 for developing countries | ↑ 30 %/yr | World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal |

### Key Takeaways

1. Global emissions are still rising, though the growth rate has slowed slightly due to decarbonization of some power sectors.
2. The climate‑change “budget” for a 1.5 °C pathway is nearly exhausted; urgent mitigation needed.
3. Extreme weather events and associated economic losses have accelerated, disproportionately affecting low‑income regions.
