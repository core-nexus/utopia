## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (FY 2024)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** | ↑ +0.97 °C vs pre‑industrial (1850–1900) | NASA GISS, 2024 update |
| **CO₂ atmospheric concentration** | 419 ppm (April 2025) | NOAA ESRL CO₂ Monthly |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | 36.7 GtC (2023) – 2.6 % higher than 2022 | IEA “World Energy Outlook 2024” |
| **Net‑zero pledges (Paris Agreement)** | 186 countries, 43 % of world GDP | UNFCCC Paris Climate Agreements database |
| **Renewable energy share of global electricity** | 29.5 % (2023) – up 1.8 pp from 2019 | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Global wind capacity** | 844 GW installed (end‑2023) | IRENA Wind Sector Overview 2024 |
| **Global solar PV capacity** | 1,108 GW installed (end‑2023) | IRENA Solar Power Market 2024 |
| **Carbon intensity of global electricity** | 0.52 kgCO₂/kWh (2023) – down 18 % from 2005 | International Energy Agency (IEA) |
| **Annual deforestation rate** | ~10 million ha/year (2019‑2023 average) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Average global sea level rise** | 3.6 mm/yr (1993‑2023) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Projected temperature by 2100 (RCP8.5)** | +4.7 °C (mid‑century) | IPCC AR6 |

*Key take‑away:* Global warming is now ~+1 °C above pre‑industrial levels, and CO₂ concentrations are approaching the historical maximum of the Anthropocene.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

1. **Direct Air Capture (DAC) Commercialization**  
   * Carbon Engineering* scaled up its DAC plant in Washington State to 0.6 MtCO₂/yr (2024). The cost dropped from $120/ton CO₂ in 2022 to $95/ton, approaching the 2025 target of <$80.

2. **Battery Energy Storage**  
   * Tesla* announced a new “Megapack” with 1‑MW/3-MWh capacity at $250/kWh (2024), reducing storage cost below the
