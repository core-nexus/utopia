## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2024)

| Indicator | Latest Value | Source |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (average 2023) | NOAA ESRL, *CO₂ Monthly* |
| **Global mean temperature rise** | +1.08 °C above pre‑industrial (1990–2022 average) | NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis |
| **Annual global greenhouse‑gas emissions** | 41.5 Gt CO₂e (2023 estimate) | UNFCCC, *Emissions Gap Report* 2024 |
| **Net‑zero target adherence** | Only 29 % of national targets are on track for 2050 net‑zero | World Resources Institute, *Net‑Zero Tracker* 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share (global)** | 28.7 % of total electricity generation | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Annual renewable capacity additions** | 140 GW in 2023; 150 GW projected for 2024 | BloombergNEF, *Global Trends* |
| **Carbon pricing coverage** | 54 countries/regions cover > 20% of global emissions (carbon price ≥ $10/t CO₂) | World Bank, *Carbon Pricing Dashboard* 2024 |
| **Deforestation loss** | 10.5 million ha/year (2019‑2023 average) | FAO & Global Forest Watch |
| **Per‑capita emissions (top 20 emitters)** | > 10 t CO₂e/cap (average) | OECD, *Emissions by Country* |

### Key Take‑aways

1. **The climate system is already in a runaway phase** – temperatures are rising faster than any historical rate for the last century.
2. **Renewable penetration has accelerated**, but fossil fuel infrastructure still dominates—particularly coal and natural gas plants slated to retire only after 2050 in many regions.
3. **Carbon pricing is expanding** but remains uneven; most high‑emission economies lack robust mechanisms.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2023** | **Direct Air Capture (DAC) scaling** – Northvolt’s DAC plant in Sweden reaches 2 MtCO₂/yr, cost reduced to $110/tonne | Opens pathway for negative emissions at commercial scale. |
|  | **Battery price decline** – Global lithium‑ion battery prices fall 30% YoY; projected <$100/kWh by 2025 | Accelerates EV and storage deployment. |
|  | **Carbon removal credit market launch** – EU introduces “Climate Neutrality Credit” to standardize DAC & BECCS credits | Provides financial incentive for negative emissions. |
| **2024** | **Advanced nuclear (SMRs)** – United States and China begin commercial SMR pilots delivering 300 MW each, with projected cost <$500/MW |
