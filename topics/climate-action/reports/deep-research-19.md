## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | 2022 Value | Trend (2020‑2023) | Source |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 419 ppm | ↑ ≈ 2 ppm/yr | NOAA ESRL, 2024 Update |
| **Global mean temperature anomaly** | +1.09 °C (vs pre‑industrial) | ↑ 0.08 °C/yr | NASA GISS, 2024 Climate Report |
| **Annual global greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂e)** | 36.3 GtCO₂e | ↓ ≈ 2 % since 2019; projected to plateau by 2035 if current policies continue | IEA Net Zero Emissions 2050 Report, 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29.1 % of global power mix | ↑ +3.7 pp/yr (2018‑23) | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Carbon intensity of global economy** | 0.41 tCO₂e/US$1bn GDP | ↓ ≈ 5 %/yr | World Bank Carbon Intensity Database, 2024 |
| **Deforestation rate (forest loss)** | 12.3 m ha/year (2019‑23 average) | ↑ +15 % vs 2000 | Global Forest Watch, 2024 |
| **Sea‑level rise** | +4.8 mm/yr (2021‑24 trend) | ↑ +0.5 mm/yr vs previous decade | IPCC AR6, 2023 |
| **Extreme heat events** | 17 % increase in frequency of >40 °C days (2000‑23) | ↑ +12 % vs 2010‑20 | NOAA Climate Data Records |

### Key Takeaways
- The world is still on a high‑emission trajectory; cumulative emissions must be capped to keep the temperature rise below 1.5 °C.
- Renewable penetration and energy efficiency gains are accelerating, but fossil fuel use remains dominant in transport and industry.
- Land‑use change (deforestation & peatland degradation) contributes ~10 % of global GHGs.
