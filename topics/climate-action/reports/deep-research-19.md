## 1. Current Global Statistics and Data  

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023–24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 419 ppm (average 2023) | NOAA ESRL, 2024 “CO₂ Monthly” |
| **Global mean temperature anomaly** | +1.11 °C relative to pre‑industrial (1850–1900) | NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP), 2024 |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | 36.3 GtC yr⁻¹ (≈37 bn tCO₂) | IEA “World Energy Outlook 2024” |
| **Net anthropogenic methane emissions** | 1,600 MtCH₄ yr⁻¹ | Global Carbon Project, 2024 |
| **Ocean acidification (pH change)** | –0.3 units since pre‑industrial | NOAA Ocean Acidification Program, 2023 |
| **Projected cumulative warming by 2100 (RCP 4.5)** | 2.1–3.0 °C | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) 2021 |
| **Global renewable energy capacity** | 3,500 GW installed | REN21 “Renewables Global Status Report 2024” |
| **Annual investment in green infrastructure** | $5.7 trn (FY24) | BloombergNEF “Green Investment Trends 2024” |

### Key Take‑aways
- CO₂ levels are now the highest recorded since the Industrial Revolution and continue to rise by ~2–3 ppm per year.
- Global temperature anomaly has surpassed the 1.5 °C threshold set by the Paris Agreement for **most of the planet** (≈60% of land area, >70% of ocean).
- Renewable energy capacity is growing rapidly, but fossil‑fuel emissions still dominate global energy consumption (~75%).

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

### 3.1 Carbon Capture, Utilisation & Storage (CCUS)
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC)**: Global DAC capacity now ~2 MtCO₂/yr; cost reduced from $600 to ~$450 per tonne of CO₂ captured (Climeworks, 2024).  
- **Mineralization**: New pilot in Iceland uses basalt‑rich volcanic rock to permanently store CO₂ at 10 ppm/yr, projected scale-up to >50 Mt
