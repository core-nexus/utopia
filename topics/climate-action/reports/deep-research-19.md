## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (2023) | Trend (2010‑2023) | Source |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | 36.6 GtCO₂ | ↑ +0.4 %/yr | World Bank “World Development Indicators” |
| **Annual temperature anomaly** | +1.11 °C above pre‑industrial | ↑ +0.02 °C/yr | NASA GISS, NOAA ESRL |
| **Sea‑level rise (1993‑2022)** | 4.8 mm/yr | ↑ +0.1 mm/yr | IPCC AR6, satellite altimetry |
| **Extreme heat events** | 13 % increase in days >40 °C (global average) | ↑ +1.5 days/decade | NOAA Climate Data Record |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29.3 % of global power generation | ↑ +2.6 %/yr | IEA “World Energy Outlook 2024” |
| **Global forest cover loss** | 10.8 M ha/year (2019‑2023 average) | ↓ –1.5 %/yr | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Carbon budget remaining (1.5 °C)** | ~350 GtCO₂ | 0.8 GtCO₂/yr remaining | IPCC AR6, “Global Warming of 1.5 °C” |

**Key Take‑aways**

- CO₂ emissions have plateaued in the last two years but remain above the Paris Agreement target trajectory.
- Global temperature has crossed the +1.1 °C threshold; extreme heat is becoming a daily reality for many regions.
- Renewable energy adoption is accelerating, yet fossil fuel infrastructure still dominates global power generation.
