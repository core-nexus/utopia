*(Prepared September 2025 – 1 page summary + in‑depth sections)*

## Executive Summary (≈250 words)

The planet is already experiencing the consequences of a 1.2 °C rise, with extreme weather events costing an estimated $3–4 trillion annually (World Bank, 2024). Global CO₂ emissions remain at ~36 GtCO₂e/year, 7% above 2019 levels, and the Paris Agreement target of < 2 °C is now widely regarded as unattainable without a rapid decarbonisation trajectory.  

Key drivers:  
- **Energy** – fossil‑fuel generation still accounts for > 60 % of electricity worldwide; coal use in Asia has plateaued but remains high.  
- **Transport** – 70 % of global transport emissions are from road freight and passenger vehicles.  
- **Land‑use change** – deforestation in the Amazon, Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia contributes ~10 GtCO₂e/year.  

The past two years (2023–24) have seen breakthrough technologies—direct air capture (DAC) at > 1 Mt/yr scale, grid‑scale battery storage surpassing 100 GWh in several countries, and AI‑driven climate‑policy optimisation tools. Yet financing gaps persist: the global green finance market is ~$2.4 trillion per year, but $5–6 trillion annually are needed to keep emissions below 1.5 °C (IEA Net Zero Emissions Scenario, 2025).  

**Actionable take‑aways:**  
- **Individuals**: adopt low‑carbon diets, support carbon‑neutral products, engage in local climate advocacy.  
- **Businesses**: set science‑based targets, disclose Scope 3 emissions, invest in circularity and renewable energy procurement.  
- **Governments**: implement carbon pricing, expand green public procurement, strengthen international cooperation on climate finance.  

The following sections unpack the data, actors, recent breakthroughs, funding landscape, barriers, evidence‑based solutions, concrete actions, and key resources.
