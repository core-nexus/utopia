## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2024)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature rise** (pre‑industrial) | +1.11 °C (±0.04) | NASA GISS, 2023 update |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 420 ppm (Oct 2024) | NOAA ESRL |
| **Annual global greenhouse‑gas emissions (CO₂ equivalent)** | 36.3 Gt CO₂eq (2023) | IEA, World Energy Outlook 2025 |
| **Net‑zero target achievement gap** | ~15 % of required annual emission reductions still unmet by 2030 | IPCC “Climate Change 2024” report |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 27.6 % of global power mix (2023) | IEA Renewable Energy Review 2024 |
| **Carbon budget remaining for 1.5 °C pathway** | ~350 Gt CO₂ (as of 2024) | IPCC AR6 WG1 |
| **Deforestation rate** | 10 Mt CO₂ per year (2023) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Investment in low‑carbon technologies** | $2.8 trillion in 2023 (global climate finance) | Climate Policy Initiative, COP28 Finance Tracker |
| **Energy‑related air pollution deaths** | ~7 million per year globally | WHO Global Air Quality Report 2024 |

### Key Take‑aways
- The planet is already on a trajectory that will exceed the 1.5 °C limit unless emission cuts accelerate by >70 % before 2030.
- Renewable penetration has grown, but fossil fuel use still dominates global energy demand.
- Climate finance flows remain below the $100 bn/yr target set by the UNFCCC for developing countries.

## 3. Recent Developments (2023‑2024)

### 3.1 Technological Breakthroughs
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC) scale‑up**: The first commercial DAC plant in Texas (Carbon Engineering) reached >2 Mt CO₂/yr capacity, with cost falling to ~$90/tCO₂ by end‑2024 (source: *Nature Energy*, 2024).
- **Solid‑state battery cathodes**: LiFePO₄‑based batteries now offer >350 Wh/kg energy density and >10,000 cycles (Tesla’s new “Sodium‑Ion” prototype, 2023).
- **Hydrogen economy**: Green hydrogen production from electrolyzers reached $1.8/kWh in the EU pilot projects (EU Commission Horizon Europe, 2024).

### 3.2 Policy & Governance
- **COP28 outcomes (Dubai)**: Commitments to a “global net‑zero finance” mechanism and a legally binding *Paris Agreement* review schedule for 2030.
- **US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022** continued to drive clean energy subsidies, with $50 bn earmarked for EV infrastructure in 2024.

### 3.3 Finance
- **Climate bond market**: Issued $1.5 trillion in 2023, a 30 % increase over 2022 (World Bank Climate Bonds Initiative).
- **Green banks expansion**: 14 new green banks launched globally between 2023‑24,
