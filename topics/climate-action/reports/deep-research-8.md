## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–24)

### 3.1 Carbon Capture, Utilization & Storage (CCUS)
* **Direct Air Capture (DAC)**: Climeworks deployed a 10‑MW DAC plant in Iceland; annual capture cost fell to $100/ton CO₂—near the “carbon price” needed for net‑zero pathways.
* **BECCS**: The first commercial-scale BECCS facility in Brazil (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) captured 1
