## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023‑24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (average 2024) | NOAA ESRL, 2024 |
| **Global mean surface temperature rise** | +1.08 °C above pre‑industrial (1890‑1920 baseline) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **Annual global carbon emissions** | ~41 GtCO₂e (including land‑use change) | Global Carbon Project, 2023 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28.1 % of total electricity generation | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Global renewable energy capacity installed (2024)** | 2,500 GW (≈ 52 % solar, 32 % wind, 10 % hydro, 6 % others) | REN21 Renewable Power Tracker 2024 |
| **Net‑zero pledges** | 140+ countries & ~30 multinationals have net‑zero targets by 2050 or earlier | Climate Action Tracker, 2025 |
| **Climate‑finance flows (public + private)** | $1.8 trillion in 2023 (UNFCCC) | UNFCCC Finance Report 2024 |
| **Extreme weather events (2023)** | 2,000+ reported worldwide; cost >$300 bn | EM-DAT, 2024 |
| **Deforestation rate** | 10.5 million ha per year (2019‑23 average) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2023 |
| **Methane emissions from agriculture & livestock** | ~1.6 GtCH₄/yr | IPCC AR6, 2022 |

### Key Takeaway
- Atmospheric CO₂ and temperature continue to climb at a rate that threatens the Paris Agreement’s “well‑below 2 °C” goal.
- Renewable energy penetration is increasing but still insufficient; fossil fuel emissions remain >80 % of total.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑24)

1. **Carbon Capture, Utilisation & Storage (CCUS)**
   - *Project: Petra Nova* (USA) – first commercial-scale post‑combustion capture at a coal plant; 5 MtCO₂ captured annually.
   - *Technology:* Direct Air Capture (DAC) with renewable energy power – cost dropped to $90/ton CO₂ in pilot projects.

2. **Renewable Energy Scale‑Up**
   - *Solar PV*: Global installed capacity hit 1,000 GW (2024); average module efficiency >23 % commercial.
   - *Wind*: Offshore wind capacity reached 120 GW; floating turbines now commercially deployed in
