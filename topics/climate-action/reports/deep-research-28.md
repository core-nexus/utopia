## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023–2024)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial baseline (1850‑1900) | NASA GISS, 2024 update |
| **Annual CO₂ emissions (global)** | 36.8 GtCO₂e (≈ 9.2 tCO₂ per capita) | International Energy Agency (IEA), World Energy Outlook 2025 |
| **Anthropogenic methane (CH₄) emissions** | 3.0 Gt CH₄ (≈ 4.7 ppm in atmosphere) | NOAA, Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Levels 2024 |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 4.9 mm/yr (average 2005–2023) | IPCC AR6, Oceanic & Cryospheric Data |
| **Global renewable electricity share** | 27 % of total electricity generation | IEA, Renewables 2024 |
| **Carbon‑neutral commitments by governments** | 124 countries have Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that aim for net zero by 2050 or earlier | UNFCCC, NDC Tracker 2025 |
| **Climate finance flow to developing countries** | $13.3 bn in 2024 (≈ $6.7 bn of public, $6.6 bn of private) | Climate Policy Initiative, Climate Finance Tracker 2024 |
| **Global forest area loss** | 12 Mt/yr of tree cover loss (2019–2023 average) | FAO, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2022 |

### Key Takeaways
- The temperature rise is now >1.0 °C above pre‑industrial levels, accelerating the rate of extreme events.
- CO₂ emissions have plateaued for the first time in 50 years but remain 9–10 % higher than 2015 levels.
- Renewable share has grown steadily but still below the ~70 % target needed by 2030 to keep warming <1.5 °C.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

1. **Direct Air Capture (DAC) Commercialization**
   - *Carbon Engineering* and *Climeworks* scaled to >10 MtCO₂/yr by end‑2024; cost now <$100/ton CO₂ in pilot plants.
2. **Next‑Gen Solar PV & Energy Storage**
   - Perovskite–silicon tandem cells achieved 28.5 % efficiency (World Renewable Energy Association, 2023).
   - Lithium‑sulfur batteries surpassed 300 Wh/kg energy density; cost <$200/kWh in pilot production.
3. **Methane Reduction**
   - Global Methane Initiative’s *“Methane Flash”* program detected and captured >15 MtCH₄ per year from oil & gas operations (2024).
4. **Afforestation & Reforestation at Scale**
   - The World Agroforestry Centre launched the “Forest for Food” project, planting 2 billion trees in sub‑Saharan Africa by 2030.
5. **Carbon Pricing Expansion**
   - EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) extended to shipping and aviation sectors; carbon price
