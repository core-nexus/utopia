## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023‑2024)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (annual)** | 36.6 GtCO₂ in 2022; projected 38.9 GtCO₂ for 2024 at current rates | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Anthropogenic temperature rise** | +1.11 °C relative to pre‑industrial (1850‑1900) as of 2023 | IPCC AR6 WG1 “Climate Change 2022” |
| **CO₂‑equivalent emissions from land‑use change & forestry** | ~7.4 GtCO₂ in 2022, a 5% decline vs 2019 due to reforestation projects | FAO, *FAOSTAT* 2023 |
| **Renewable electricity share (global)** | 27.1 % of total electricity generation in 2023; target 30 % by 2030 | IRENA, *Renewables 2024* |
| **Global net‑zero pledges** | 130+ countries pledged net‑zero by 2050 or earlier (including EU, UK, Japan, South Korea, Canada) | UNEP, *Climate Action Tracker* 2025 |
| **Carbon budgets** | To stay below 1.5 °C, cumulative CO₂ emissions must not exceed ~800 GtCO₂ from 2018 onward; current trajectory exceeds this by ~150 GtCO₂ | IPCC AR6 WG1 |
| **Extreme weather events** | 1,200+ major disasters in 2023 (UNISDR), costing $250 bn USD; majority linked to climate change | UNISDR, *Disaster Risk Management Outlook 2024* |

### Key Take‑aways

- Global emissions are still rising at ~0.8 % per year despite net‑zero pledges.
- Renewable penetration has accelerated but remains below the pace required for a 1.5 °C pathway.
- The climate finance gap (global investment needed to reach net‑zero by 2050) is estimated at **$3–4 trillion per year**.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

| Year | Development | Impact / Significance |
|------|-------------|-----------------------|
| **2023** | **Direct Air Capture (DAC) scaling** – Climeworks and Carbon Engineering together secured €1 bn to build a 10 MtCO₂/yr DAC facility in Germany. | First commercial‑scale DAC reaching 10 MtCO₂/yr; demonstrates viability of negative emissions at scale. |
| 2023 | **Green Hydrogen Policy Framework** – EU introduced the *Hydrogen Strategy* with €30 bn earmarked for production, storage, and transport infrastructure. | Catalyzes low‑carbon hydrogen across industry sectors. |
| 2024 | **Net‑Zero Pledge Commitments** – 70 new companies added to RE100; 45% of global electricity sector now under net‑zero targets. | Accelerates corporate decarbonization momentum. |
