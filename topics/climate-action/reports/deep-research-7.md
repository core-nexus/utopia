## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023–2024)

| Indicator | Value (latest) | Trend | Source |
|-----------|----------------|-------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | **36.6 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹** (2023, IEA) | ↑ 1.5 % YoY | IEA, *World Energy Outlook* 2024 |
| **Temperature anomaly (global mean)** | **+1.11 °C** vs pre‑industrial (Dec 2023, NOAA/ESRL) | +0.02 °C per decade | NOAA, *Global Climate Report – Dec 2023* |
| **Sea‑level rise rate** | **4.8 mm yr⁻¹** (last 10 yr average, IPCC AR6 WG1) | ↑ 0.2 mm yr⁻¹ relative to 2010–2020 | IPCC AR6, *Synthesis Report* |
| **Carbon budget remaining (to stay <1.5 °C)** | ~**350 GtCO₂** (assuming 10 % probability) | Depleting by ~2 % yr⁻¹ | IPCC AR6, *Climate Change 2023* |
| **Renewable electricity share** | **29 % of global power generation** (2024, IEA) | ↑ 1.5 pp YoY | IEA, *World Energy Outlook* 2024 |
| **Global green hydrogen production capacity** | **~150 Mt H₂ yr⁻¹** (2023, Hydrogen Council) | ↑ 20 % YoY | Hydrogen Council, *Hydrogen Outlook* 2024 |
| **Climate finance to developing countries** | **$58 bn** (FY24, UNFCCC Finance Tracker) | ↓ 5 % YoY | UNFCCC, *Finance Tracker* 2024 |
| **Number of climate‑related lawsuits filed globally** | **~2,200** (Jan–Oct 2024, Climate Litigation Tracker) | ↑ 12 % YoY | Climate Action Network |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Emissions are still on an upward trajectory**, though growth rates have slowed slightly due to policy tightening in some regions.
2. **Temperature rise is accelerating**; the 1.5 °C threshold is now a “very real” risk for many low‑lying and high‑latitude nations.
3. **Renewable penetration remains below the 2030 target** of 55 % (IEA, *Net Zero by 2050*), indicating a shortfall in deployment pace.
4. **Climate finance gaps are widening**, especially in Sub‑Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.
