## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023–2024)

| Indicator | Value (2023) | Trend (2019‑24) | Source |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** | 36.7 GtCO₂e | ↑ 0.5 %/yr after 2021 dip | IEA, *World Energy Outlook* 2024 |
| **Temperature rise (pre‑industrial)** | +1.10 °C | ↑ 0.02 °C/yr | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Sea level rise** | 4.5 mm/yr | ↑ 0.2 mm/yr | NOAA, *Sea Level Rise* 2024 |
| **Per‑capita emissions (global average)** | 5.4 tCO₂e | ↑ 0.1 t/yr | UNFCCC Data Explorer |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28 % of global electricity generation | +2 pp/yr | REN21, *Renewables Global Status Report* 2024 |
| **Carbon‑neutral commitments (net‑zero by 2050)** | 75 % of major economies | ↑ 5 %/yr | Climate Action Tracker |
| **Climate finance disbursed (public + private)** | $540 bn in 2023 | ↑ 8 %/yr | World Bank, *Climate Finance* 2024 |

**Key take‑away:**  
The world is still on a high‑emission trajectory; only 28 % of electricity comes from renewables and net‑zero pledges remain largely unverified. Climate finance has increased but falls short of the $2–3 trillion annual target for developing countries.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

### 3.1 Technological Innovations

| Innovation | Impact | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **Direct Air Capture (DAC) with carbon mineralisation** | > 50 MtCO₂ captured in pilot projects | Commercial pilots in Iceland, Sweden |
| **Advanced nuclear – Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)** | 1–5 GW capacity, lower upfront cost | Pilot plant in Finland, USA (2024) |
| **Battery‑storage scaling: Li‑S & solid‑state batteries** | Energy density > 500 Wh/kg | Commercialized by 2025 for grid storage |
| **Biochar for soil carbon sequestration** | Sequesters 1–2 tCO₂/ha/year | Pilot in Brazil, Kenya (2024) |

### 3.2 Policy & Market Mechanisms

* **EU’s “Fit for 55” package** – introduces a binding EU ETS cap cut of 37 % by 2030.  
* **U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)** – $369 bn climate‑finance, including tax credits for EVs and renewables.
