## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Trend (2019–2024) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | **36.3 Gt CO₂ yr⁻¹** (IEA, 2024) | ↑5 % since 2019, +12 % from 1990 |
| **Global temperature rise** | **1.09 °C above pre‑industrial** (IPCC AR6, 2023) | ↑0.04 °C per year |
| **Sea‑level rise** | **4.5 mm yr⁻¹** (NOAA, 2024) | Accelerating – 7 mm yr⁻¹ since 2018 |
| **Extreme weather events** | ~ 2 × more frequent than 1990 levels (UNEP, 2023) | ↑30 % in the last decade |
| **Renewable electricity share** | **29.1 % of global power mix** (IEA, 2024) | +4 pp since 2019 |
| **Net‑zero pledges** | 78 countries/regions, 50+ large corporations (UNFCCC, 2023) | 25 % of pledged emissions cut still unverified |
| **Carbon budgets** | Global budget to stay below 1.5 °C: ~ 400 Gt CO₂ remaining (IPCC AR6, 2024) | Only 30 % of that budget has been allocated |

> **Key takeaway:** The planet is on a trajectory that will exceed the Paris Agreement targets unless emissions are curtailed by > 70 % before 2030 and net‑zero achieved by 2050.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

| Year | Breakthrough / Development | Impact |
|------|---------------------------|--------|
| **2023** | *Direct Air Capture* (DAC) pilot at Lanzatech, Germany – 100 t CO₂ captured per day | Demonstrates scalable DAC; cost projected to drop from $600/ton to <$200/ton by 2030 |
|          | *Next‑generation solar PV* with perovskite–silicon tandem cells > 28 % efficiency (NREL, 2023) | Potentially halves silicon wafer usage, cutting manufacturing emissions |
|          | EU’s “Fit for 55” package – mandates 37 % renewable share by 2030 and introduces a CO₂ border adjustment mechanism | Sets new regulatory benchmark; expected to shift global supply chains |
| **2024** | *Battery‑grid scale* storage – Tesla's Megapack deployed in Israel, 300 MW/1.2 GWh (Tesla Energy, 2024) | Enables
