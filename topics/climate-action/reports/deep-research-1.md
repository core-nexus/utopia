## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2024)

| Indicator | Value (latest year) | Source |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (≈ 0.042 % of atmosphere) | NOAA, Global Monitoring Laboratory, 2024 |
| **Global mean temperature rise since pre‑industrial** | +1.11 °C (± 0.02 °C) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Average annual global temperature anomaly (2023)** | +1.08 °C | NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis |
| **Sea level rise (1993‑2023 average)** | 4.9 mm / yr | NOAA, 2024 |
| **Annual global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions** | 59 GtCO₂e (≈ 1.6 t per capita) | World Bank GHG Emissions Data, 2023 |
| **Share of renewables in global electricity generation** | 27 % (grid‑connected) | IEA Power System Statistics, 2024 |
| **Global renewable capacity addition (2023)** | 140 GW (wind & solar) | IRENA Renewable Capacity Database, 2024 |
| **Net-zero pledges by governments (as of Dec 2023)** | 120 countries | Climate Action Tracker |
| **Climate‑related extreme weather events** | 1.2 million people affected in 2023 alone | EM-DAT, 2024 |
| **Projected global temperature rise without further mitigation (by 2100)** | 3–5 °C | IPCC AR6, Scenario RCP8.5 |

### Key Take‑aways
* Atmospheric CO₂ is now the highest it has been in ~800 k years.  
* Global emissions have plateaued for the first time in 50 years but remain far above the 1.5 °C pathway.  
* Renewable penetration is rising rapidly, yet fossil fuels still account for >70 % of primary energy consumption.
