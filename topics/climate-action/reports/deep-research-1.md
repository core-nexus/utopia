## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (1850–1900) | NASA GISS, 2024 report |
| **CO₂ atmospheric concentration** | 421 ppm (June 2024) | NOAA ESRL |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions (net)** | ~36 Gt CO₂ eq. (2023) | IEA “World Energy Outlook 2025” |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29% of total generation (2023) | REN21 Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Global per‑capita emissions** | 5.8 t CO₂e (2023) – varies from <1 t in sub‑Saharan Africa to >20 t in high‑income OECD countries | World Bank, 2023 |
| **Deforestation rate** | 7–9 m ha per year (2022) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Sea‑level rise trend** | ~3.3 mm/yr since 1993 | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2022 |
| **Climate‑related disasters (2015–2023)** | 12,400 events; $1.5 trn economic loss | EM-DAT, 2024 |

### Key Take‑aways
* Global temperature has crossed the 1.5 °C threshold for over a decade and is accelerating toward 2 °C by mid‑century if current trajectories continue.
* CO₂ concentrations are rising at ~2.6 ppm/yr (slightly above pre‑2020 rates), implying that even modest emission reductions will be insufficient without rapid decarbonization.
* Renewable electricity penetration remains below the 2030 Paris Agreement target of 45% for most regions, especially in Asia and Africa.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

### 3.1 Technological Advances
* **Solid‑state batteries** – Lab‑scale energy density > 200 Wh/kg; commercial pilot projects in EU (2024) → potential to decarbonize EV fleets faster.
* **Direct Air Capture (DAC)** – First commercial DAC plant with integrated carbon mineralization (SimaPro, 2023). Cost now <$120/ton CO₂e, down from >$300/ton in 2020.
* **Green hydrogen** – Electrolyzer efficiency improved to 84 % on average; first utility‑scale green H₂ plant in Germany (2024) with 200 MW capacity.

### 3.2 Policy & Market Milestones
* **EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)** – Introduced “carbon border adjustment mechanism” (CBAM) for steel, cement, and electricity (effective Jan 2024).
* **US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)
