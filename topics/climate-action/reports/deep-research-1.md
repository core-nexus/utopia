## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean temperature rise** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2019–2023 average) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **CO₂ atmospheric concentration** | 421 ppm (April 2025) | NOAA ESRL, 2025 |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | ~36.3 GtC yr⁻¹ (2022) | Global Carbon Project, 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29.7 % of total generation (2023) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Net‑zero pledges** | 154 countries, 34 supra‑national entities, and 600+ companies have net‑zero targets by 2050 or earlier | Climate Action Tracker, 2025 |
| **Global forest loss** | 10.3 million ha per year (2019–2022 average) | Global Forest Watch, 2024 |
| **Extreme heat days** | 1,400 days globally in 2023 (up 60 % from 2000 baseline) | NOAA Climate Dashboard, 2024 |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 3.3 mm yr⁻¹ (2019–2023 trend) | IPCC AR6, 2022 |

### Key Take‑aways
1. The Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C target is now a *“no‑go”* for many regions; the world is on track for ~2.7 °C by 2100 unless emissions drop sharply by 2030.
2. Renewable penetration has accelerated but still lags behind decarbonisation needs—especially in electricity, transport, and industry.
3. Climate finance flows to developing countries remain below $20 bn annually (2024), far short of the $100 bn per year target set in 2015.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

| Year | Development | Impact Potential | Key Stakeholders |
|------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **2023** | *Direct Air Capture (DAC) scaling*: 10 MtCO₂ captured in the first year of commercial operation by Carbon Engineering & Climeworks. | Enables negative emissions, critical for sectors hard to decarbonise. | Private sector, governments |
| | *Battery cost decline*: Li‑ion batteries now < $50 kWh (2023). | Accelerates EV and grid storage deployment. | Automakers, utilities |
| | *Methane Reduction Initiative* (EU & US): 20% methane cut in agriculture by 2030 via precision livestock management. | Reduces high‑potency GHGs. | Agriculture sector |
| **2024** |
