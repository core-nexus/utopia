## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest) | Trend 2020‑24 | Source |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial | ↑ 0.03 °C/yr | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (Dec 2023) | ↑ 2.5 ppm/yr | NOAA ESRL, 2024 |
| **Annual global emissions (CO₂ equivalent)** | 59 GtCO₂e (2023) | ↓ 0.8 %/yr (mainly due to pandemic rebound) | BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2024 |
| **Renewable share in final energy consumption** | 29 % (2023) | ↑ 2 ppy | IEA Renewables 2024 |
| **Global net‑zero pledges** | 154 countries & 32 multinationals | ↑ 15 % since 2019 | Climate Action Tracker, 2024 |
| **Annual climate finance to developing countries** | $51.6 bn (2023) | ↓ 8 % vs 2022 | UNFCCC Finance Report, 2024 |
| **Per‑capita emissions in high‑income OECD** | 12.5 tCO₂e | ↑ 0.4 t/yr | OECD Emissions Database, 2024 |
| **Per‑capita emissions in low‑income LMICs** | 1.2 tCO₂e | ↓ 0.05 t/yr | World Bank, 2024 |

### Key Take‑aways
* Global temperature is approaching the 1.5 °C limit; further warming will likely cross it by 2030 if emissions continue on current trajectory.  
* CO₂ concentrations are rising at a rate that would require >50 % additional emission cuts to stay below 1.5 °C.  
* Renewable energy penetration has accelerated, but fossil fuel subsidies and coal‑based power remain major impediments.
