## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023–24) | Trend (2019‑23) |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial (IPCC AR6, 2023) | ↑0.01 °C/yr |
| **CO₂ atmospheric concentration** | 423 ppm (Oct 2024) | ↑~2.5 ppm/yr |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | 36.8 GtC (≈ 140 GtCO₂e) | ↓0.3 % YoY, but still 1.7× 1990 level |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28 % of global generation (IEA, 2024) | ↑0.5 %/yr |
| **Energy‑related CO₂ intensity** | 320 gCO₂/kWh | ↓0.8 %/yr |
| **Methane concentration** | 1.9 ppb (Oct 2024) | ↑~3 ppb/yr |
| **Land‑use change emissions** | 7.6 GtCO₂e (FAO, 2023) | ↓0.2 %/yr |
| **Climate finance disbursement** | $1.5 trillion (World Bank, 2024) | ↑10 % YoY |

*Key take‑aways*

- The global temperature trajectory still projects >1.5 °C warming by 2050 under current pledges.  
- Fossil‑fuel CO₂ remains the dominant source; renewables and electrification have outpaced growth but lag behind Paris targets.  
- Methane—responsible for ~25 % of radiative forcing—continues to rise, underscoring its urgency.

## 3. Recent Developments (2023‑24)

### A. Policy & Finance

1. **Paris Agreement “Fit for 55” Package** – EU’s legislative framework targeting a 55 % emission cut by 2030; introduces the *EU Emissions Trading System* expansion and *Climate Law*.  
2. **United States Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – Clean Energy Investment Tax Credits (ITC)** – Boosts solar & battery storage deployment; forecasted to add ~1.5 GW of new solar capacity by 2026.  
3. **China’s Green Finance Blueprint** – Launch of a $200 bn green bond market pilot, covering renewable infrastructure and carbon capture projects.
