## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** | 36.4 GtCO₂e (≈10 % rise YoY) | *IEA World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Average global temperature increase** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial baseline (2023 mean) | *NOAA Global Surface Temperature Report* |
| **Per‑capita emissions (2022)** | 5.6 tCO₂e | *World Bank* |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29.8 % of global power generation | *IRENA 2024 Global Energy Statistics* |
| **Carbon intensity of global energy mix** | 0.51 kg CO₂/kWh | *IEA* |
| **Sea‑level rise (1981–2023)** | 3.2 mm/yr | *IPCC AR6 WG1* |
| **Global deforestation rate (2023)** | 4.9 m ha/yr | *FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment* |
| **Net‑zero pledges by 2050** | 85 % of G20 economies, 75 % of major emitters | *UNFCCC Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Tracker* |

### Key Takeaway
The planet is warming at an unprecedented pace, with CO₂ emissions rising despite strong policy signals. Renewable energy penetration remains below the threshold needed to meet Paris‑COP26 commitments.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

1. **Carbon Capture, Utilisation & Storage (CCUS)**  
   - *Scale‑up*: 20 MtCO₂ captured in commercial projects worldwide (2024).  
   - *Innovation*: Direct Air Capture (DAC) cost fell to $90/tonne CO₂ in the EU (European Commission DAC study).

2. **Renewable Energy Cost Trajectories**  
   - Solar PV: Levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) dropped 42 % from 2020 to 2023 (IEA).  
   - Onshore wind: LCOE fell 35 % in the same period.

3. **Energy‑Storage Breakthroughs**  
   - Solid‑state batteries achieve >250 Wh/kg energy density, pilot deployments in electric buses (Toyota, Hyundai).

4. **Nature‑Based Solutions (NbS)**  
   - Global reforestation projects sequester ~0.5 GtCO₂e annually (FAO).  
   - Mangrove restoration in Southeast Asia reduces coastal erosion by 30 % and sequesters 2–3 tCO₂/ha/year.

5. **Policy Milestones**  
   - EU’s *Fit for 55* package: 37 % renewable share target by 2030, carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) in force.  
   - UK’s *Net‑Zero Strategy*: 45 % reduction in emissions by 2030; introduces "Climate Finance Tax".

6. **Financial Innovation**  
   - $1.2 trn green bonds issued in 2023, a 12 % YoY increase (World Bank).
