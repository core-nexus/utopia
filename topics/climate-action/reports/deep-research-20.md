## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023‑24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** | 36.4 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ (≈ 10 % increase from 2019) | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Average global temperature rise** | 1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (UNEP/IPCC AR6 2023) | IPCC, *AR6 Climate Change 2023* |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 4.8 mm yr⁻¹ (historical average) – projected 7–10 mm yr⁻¹ by 2050 | NOAA, *Sea Level Rise Projection* |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 30.5 % of global power generation | REN21, *Renewables 2024* |
| **Net‑zero pledges (countries)** | 112 countries with legally binding net‑zero targets by 2050 | Climate Action Tracker, April 2025 |
| **Global investment in clean tech** | $1.2 trn 2023 (≈ 15 % of global GDP) | BloombergNEF, *Clean Energy Investment* |
| **Carbon removal projects (CCS/BECCS)** | 22 GW of installed capacity; projected 200 GW by 2030 | IEA, *Climate Change 2024* |
| **Deforestation rate** | 10 million ha per year (2019‑2023 trend) | FAO, *Global Forest Resources Assessment 2025* |

### Key Takeaways
- The planet is on a trajectory that would exceed the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C limit without urgent action.
- Renewable penetration has accelerated but still lags behind the decarbonization pace required by 2030.
- Climate finance flows remain below the $100 bn/year threshold needed for developing‑country adaptation and mitigation.
