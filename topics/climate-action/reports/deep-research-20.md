## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023–2024)

| Indicator | Latest Value | Trend (2019–2024) | Source |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | **36.7 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹** (≈ 5 % rise from 2022) | ↑ 1.6 % annually, highest since 1990 | IEA “World Energy Outlook 2024” |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | **419 ppm** (≈ 3 ppm/yr increase) | Continuous rise; 2023 record of 421 ppm | NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory |
| **Average global temperature anomaly** | **+1.09 °C** relative to pre‑industrial | ↑ 0.02 °C per year over last decade | IPCC AR6 WG1 (2022) |
| **Sea‑level rise** | **3.4 mm yr⁻¹** (latest 5‑yr trend) | Accelerating; 2024 average of 3.7 mm yr⁻¹ | NOAA/NOAA Climate Data Record |
| **Renewable energy share in global electricity mix** | **29 %** (2023) | ↑ 2 pp per year | REN21 “Renewables Global Status Report 2024” |
| **Net‑zero pledges by countries** | **78 % of G20 GDP** committed to net‑zero by 2050 | Increasing; 2024 saw 15 new country commitments | Climate Action Tracker (CAT) |
| **Global investment in climate technologies** | **$1.3 trn (FY23)** | ↑ 7 % YoY | BloombergNEF “Clean Energy Investment Trends” |
| **Carbon pricing coverage** | **~35 % of global emissions** | ↑ 5 pp per year | World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard |

> **Key Takeaway:** Global emissions are still on an upward trajectory, but investment in low‑carbon technologies and policy momentum (net‑zero pledges, carbon pricing) are accelerating. The gap between current emissions trajectories and the Paris Agreement temperature targets remains >1 °C.
