## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023–2024)

| Indicator | Latest Value | Source (accessed May 2025) |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (annual)** | 36.7 Gt CO₂ (≈ 8% increase vs. 2022) | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Annual temperature anomaly** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial baseline (2023 average) | NOAA Global Surface Temperature Report 2024 |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 4.9 mm/yr (1993–2023 mean) | IPCC AR6, *Synthesis Report* |
| **Per‑capita emissions (global)** | 5.8 t CO₂ per person | World Bank Climate Data API |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28% of global power generation (2024) | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Net‑zero pledges** | 1,300+ national commitments; 60% still “unambitious” | Climate Action Tracker, *Global Net‑Zero 2025* |
| **Carbon budget remaining at 2 °C pathway** | ~350 Gt CO₂ (as of 2024) | IPCC AR6 |
| **Greenhouse gas concentration (CO₂)** | 421 ppm (2023 average) | NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory |
| **Deforestation rate** | 10.7 million ha/yr (2023 estimate) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |

### Key Take‑aways
- CO₂ emissions continue to rise, with a 8 % jump in 2023 despite strong policy signals.
- Renewable penetration is improving but remains below the 50 % threshold required for a 1.5 °C pathway by 2030.
- The carbon budget remaining at the 2 °C target is exhausted within the next decade if current trajectories continue.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

### 3.1 Technological
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC) Scale‑Up**  
  - *Climeworks* and *Carbon Engineering* launched first commercial DAC plants in Europe (capacity: 10 kt CO₂/yr).  
  - Cost reduced from ~$400/kg CO₂ to ~$250/kg by integrating waste heat.
- **Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)**  
  - Solid‑state battery pilot by Tesla in Nevada, achieving 200 Wh/kg energy density.  
  - Grid‑scale BESS deployment in Germany: >1 GW installed capacity (2024).
- **Next
