## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023–mid‑2024)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** (1990–2022) | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels | NASA GISS, 2023 |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** (2023) | 36.7 GtCO₂e | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Global net anthropogenic CO₂ emissions** (2023) | 9.2 GtCO₂e | UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2024 |
| **Per‑capita emissions (world average)** | 5.1 tCO₂e/year | OECD/IEA, 2023 |
| **Global renewable electricity share** (2023) | 27.6 % of total electricity generation | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Total global renewable capacity added (2010–2023)** | ~1,100 GW (wind + solar) | REN21 Renewables 2024 |
| **Global deforestation rate** (2022) | 10.5 m ha/yr | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Carbon budget remaining for 1.5 °C** (as of 2023) | ~300–350 GtCO₂e | IPCC AR6, 2023 |
| **Global climate finance disbursed** (2018‑2023) | $1.7 trillion | Climate Policy Initiative – Climate Finance Tracker 2024 |
| **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) alignment with 1.5 °C** (average) | 45 % of target emissions | UNFCCC NDC Tracker 2024 |

### Key Take‑aways
* Global temperature is approaching the threshold that would trigger runaway feedback loops.
* CO₂ emissions are still rising, driven mainly by fossil fuel combustion and land‑use change.
* Renewable energy growth is accelerating but remains below what is required for net‑zero by mid‑century.
* Climate finance has grown markedly in recent years, yet gaps persist between needs and available funds.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

### 3.1 Technological Advances
* **Direct Air Capture (DAC) scaling** – Northvolt’s DAC plant in Sweden achieved first commercial scale output of 2 MtCO₂/yr, reducing cost to ~$100/t CO₂e (source: *Nature Energy*, 2024).  
* **Battery energy storage** – Tesla and LG Chem launched a 20‑GWh lithium‑iron‑phosphate pack for grid stabilization at $150/kWh (IEA Battery Outlook 2024).  
* **Green hydrogen** – Europe’s “Hydrogen 2030” roadmap outlines 1.2 GW of electrolyzers, with pilot projects in Germany and the UK producing H₂ at <$5/kg (EU
