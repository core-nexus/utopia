## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest year) | Trend |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| **Global mean temperature rise** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (IPCC AR6, 2023) | Upward trend; 0.17 °C per decade since 1979 |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 420 ppm (April 2025) | Rising at ~2.7 ppm/yr |
| **Annual global GHG emissions** | 62.6 GtCO₂e (2023, WRI) | 1.5 % increase from 2022; 3–4 % below 2020 peak |
| **Net anthropogenic warming potential of aerosols** | –0.8 W/m² | Slightly decreasing due to air‑quality regulations |
| **Global renewable electricity capacity** | 2800 GW (end 2024, IRENA) | +12 % vs 2023; 46 % of total power capacity |
| **Energy share from renewables** | 28.9 % of final energy use (IEA, 2024) | Upward trend; projected 45 % by 2040 under current policies |
| **Land‑use emissions** | 5.6 GtCO₂e (2023, GHG Protocol) | 2 % increase from 2022 due to deforestation in the Amazon and Southeast Asia |
| **Methane concentration** | 1.85 ppm (2024, NOAA) | +0.04 ppm/yr since 2015 |
| **Per‑capita emissions (high‑income)** | 12.3 tCO₂e (2023, World Bank) | ~10 % decline over last decade |

**Key takeaways**

1. Global warming is already at a tipping point; the next 15–20 years are critical for limiting the 1.5 °C target.  
2. Renewable electricity has outpaced fossil‑fuel capacity growth by a factor of ~3, but total energy demand continues to rise.  
3. Land‑use and methane remain significant non‑CO₂ sources that require targeted interventions.
