## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | 2023 Value | Trend (2019–2024) | Source |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| **CO₂ emissions (Mt CO₂)** | 36.7 Mt | ↑ 0.6 % from 2022 | UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2024 |
| **Global temperature rise** | +1.08 °C above pre‑industrial | ↑ 0.02 °C per decade | IPCC Sixth Assessment (2023) |
| **Sea‑level rise (mm/yr)** | 4.7 mm/yr | ↑ 10 % from 2019 | NOAA Sea Level Rise Report 2024 |
| **Renewable share of global electricity** | 28 % | +5 pp over five years | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Carbon intensity (kg CO₂/kWh)** | 280 kg | ↓ 12 % from 2019 | International Energy Agency (IEA) |
| **Methane emissions (Gt CH₄/yr)** | 5.8 Gt | ↑ 1.2 % annually | Global Methane Initiative (2024) |
| **Per‑capita CO₂ (global average)** | 4.7 t | ↑ 0.15 t per year | World Bank Data 2023 |
| **Global forest loss (Mt²/yr)** | 12 Mt² | ↓ 22 % from 2019 | Global Forest Watch 2024 |

**Key Take‑aways**

* Global CO₂ emissions grew slightly in 2023, driven by fossil‑fuel combustion and industrial processes.  
* Renewable energy penetration has accelerated but still falls short of the 2030 net‑zero target for most regions.  
* Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is on an upward trajectory, largely from agriculture and natural gas infrastructure.
