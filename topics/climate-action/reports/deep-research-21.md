## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023/24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (1850‑1900) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (average of 2023) | NOAA ESRL, 2024 |
| **Annual global greenhouse gas emissions** | 59.9 GtCO₂e (≈ 1.25 % of GDP) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Net anthropogenic CO₂ emissions (2023)** | 36.5 GtCO₂ | Global Carbon Project, 2024 |
| **Global carbon budget remaining for 2 °C pathway** | ~450 GtCO₂ (≈ 12 years at current rate) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Renewable electricity share of global power mix** | 28.5 % (2023) | IEA Renewable Energy Statistics 2024 |
| **Global cumulative renewable capacity added (2010‑24)** | +1,350 GW | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Climate‑related extreme weather events (2023)** | 7.6 × 10⁶ people affected, $125 bn damage | EM-DAT, 2024 |
| **Per capita annual CO₂ emissions (high‑income OECD)** | 11.8 tCO₂ | OECD Env. Data 2024 |
| **Per capita annual CO₂ emissions (low‑income developing countries)** | 1.2 tCO₂ | World Bank 2024 |

**Key take‑aways**

* The world is still on a trajectory that will exceed the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C target unless global emissions fall by ~45 % by 2030 and reach net zero around 2050.  
* Renewable energy capacity continues to grow rapidly, but fossil fuel use remains dominant in transport and industry.  
* Climate‑related disasters are increasing in frequency and cost, underscoring the urgency of adaptation.
