## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature rise** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2019–2023 average) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **CO₂ atmospheric concentration** | 421 ppm (May 2025) | NOAA ESRL |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | 36.6 Gt CO₂eq (2022) | IEA Emissions Database |
| **Share of renewables in global electricity generation** | 28% (2023) | REN21 Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Global renewable capacity added in 2023** | +112 GW (mostly solar & wind) | IRENA, 2024 |
| **Climate‑related extreme events** | 1,120 climate‑driven disasters in 2023, causing > 400,000 deaths and $280 bn in damages | EM-DAT |
| **Net‑Zero pledges** | 123 countries pledged net‑zero by 2050 or sooner (2024) | Climate Action Tracker |
| **Carbon budget for 1.5 °C** | ≤ 420 Gt CO₂ from 2019 onwards | IPCC AR6, 2022 |

### Key Take‑aways
- Global temperature has crossed the 1.5 °C threshold; further warming is projected to reach 3–4 °C by 2100 without deep cuts.
- CO₂ concentrations are rising at ~1.8 ppm per year – a rate unprecedented in the last 800,000 years (paleoclimate data).
- Renewable electricity share has grown rapidly but remains below the 60% threshold required for net‑zero by mid‑century.
