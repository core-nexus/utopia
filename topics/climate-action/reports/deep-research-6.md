## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value | Source (Year) |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Global mean temperature rise (pre‑industrial)** | +1.09 °C (≈ +1.9 °F) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **Projected temperature by 2100 (RCP 6.0)** | +3.2 °C | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **CO₂ atmospheric concentration** | 421 ppm | NOAA, 2025 |
| **Annual global anthropogenic CO₂ emissions** | ~36 GtC yr⁻¹ (≈ 141 GtCO₂) | Global Carbon Project, 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 27.3 % of total generation | IEA, 2024 |
| **Global renewable capacity added (2019‑24)** | +140 GW (solar + wind) | REN21, 2025 |
| **Carbon intensity of global economy** | 0.36 tCO₂e per USD 1,000 | World Bank, 2024 |
| **Climate‑related extreme events (2023)** | 1,200+ fatalities worldwide; $300 bn damage | EM-DAT, 2025 |
| **Forest loss (2019‑24)** | 10.7 M ha/year average | FAO, 2025 |

**Key take‑aways**

* Global temperatures are now >1.1 °C above pre‑industrial levels and on a trajectory to exceed the Paris target of 1.5 °C unless emissions fall by ~45 % by 2030.
* Renewable energy is growing fastest, but fossil fuel use still dominates (≈ 79 % of global primary energy in 2023).
* Climate‑related disasters are increasing in frequency and cost; adaptation budgets lag behind need.
