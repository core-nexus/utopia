## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023–24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 420 ppm (≈ 2.3 % /yr increase) | NOAA ESRL – *Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center* (CDIAC), 2024 |
| **Global mean temperature anomaly** | +1.09 °C relative to pre‑industrial (1850–1900) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **Sea‑level rise rate** | 3.3 mm /yr (2019–2023 average) | IPCC AR6, 2022 |
| **Extreme heat days (> 38 °C)** | 1.5 million extra days globally in 2023 vs. 1990 baseline | NOAA, 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29 % of global electricity generation (2023) | IRENA, 2024 |
| **Global carbon budget remaining (≤ 1.5 °C)** | ~350 GtCO₂ (≈ 10 yr at 2023 emissions) | IPCC AR6, 2022 |
| **Greenhouse gas emissions by sector** | • Electricity & heat: 42 % <br>• Transport: 24 % <br>• Industry: 21 % <br>• Agriculture, forestry & land use (AFOLU): 12 % | UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2024 |
| **Climate finance received by developing countries** | $65 bn in 2023 (≈ 10 % of total climate finance) | UNFCCC Finance Tracker, 2024 |

### Key Take‑aways
- The global carbon budget is rapidly depleting; staying below 1.5 °C requires net zero by ~2030 and negative emissions thereafter.
- Renewable share of electricity is rising but still far from the 70–80 % needed for a 1.5 °C pathway.
- Finance flows remain skewed toward developed economies; emerging markets require at least 2× more support.
