## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2024) | Trend / Context |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | **≈ 419 ppm** (NOAA) | +0.8 ppm/year; surpassed the 400‑ppm threshold for the first time in ~3 million years. |
| **Global average temperature anomaly** | **+1.91 °C vs pre‑industrial** (NASA GISS) | 2024 was the 5th warmest year on record. |
| **Annual CO₂ emissions** | **≈ 36 GtCO₂e** (IEA, 2023 data extrapolated to 2024) | Slight decline from 2019 due to COVID‑19 rebound but still 10% above 2018 levels. |
| **Sectoral breakdown (2023)** | • Power & Heat: 39 % <br>• Transport: 24 % <br>• Industry: 21 % <br>• Agriculture, Forestry & Other Land Use (AFOLU): 13 % <br>• Buildings: 4 % | Power remains the largest source; AFOLU still a net sink but under threat. |
| **Renewable electricity share** | **≈ 29 % of global generation** (IEA, 2023) | Growing at ~5 % per year; solar PV capacity added >120 GW in 2023 alone. |
| **Net‑Zero commitments by major economies** | • EU: Net‑zero by 2050 (already in force). <br>• China: Net‑zero by 2060 (policy committed). <br>• USA: Net‑zero by 2050 under Biden administration. | Commitment rates rising, but implementation lag remains. |
| **Climate finance** | **$1.9 trillion pledged in 2023 (Climate Action Tracker)** | Only ~30 % delivered; $600 bn shortfall for developing countries. |
