## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Global Status (2023) | Trend (2010‑2023) |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂** | 419 ppm (≈ 4 % above pre‑industrial) | ↑ 2 ppm/yr |
| **Global Surface Temperature Anomaly** | +1.12 °C vs 1850‑1900 baseline | ↑ ~0.02 °C/yr |
| **Annual Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions** | 59.5 GtCO₂e (≈ 15 % higher than 2019) | ↑ 1.2 %/yr |
| **Renewable Energy Share of Total Generation** | 29 % (incl. hydro, wind, solar, bioenergy) | ↑ 3 %/yr |
| **Net‑Zero Commitments (by country)** | 115 countries (≈ 65 % of global GDP) | ↑ 5 per year |
| **Global Energy Poverty** | 770 million people lack reliable electricity | ↓ 4 %/yr but still high in Sub‑Saharan Africa & South Asia |
| **Carbon Intensity of Electricity (CO₂/kWh)** | 0.45 kg CO₂/kWh | ↓ 5 %/yr |
| **Forest Cover** | 31 % of land area (~4.06 billion ha) | ↓ 1 %/yr, but afforestation in Asia & Africa offset some losses |

**Key Take‑away:**  
- Emissions continue to rise despite net‑zero pledges; the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to < 2 °C is on track for a 3–4 °C trajectory unless drastic cuts are made by 2030.  
- Renewable energy penetration has accelerated, but fossil fuel subsidies and coal expansion in China & India remain major hurdles.
