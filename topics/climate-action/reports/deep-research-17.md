## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023‑24)

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Global mean temperature rise (since pre‑industrial)** | **+1.12 °C** (2023 average) | IPCC, *AR6* (2022) |
| **Annual CO₂ emissions (2023)** | **≈ 36 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹** | Global Carbon Project (GCP) 2024 update |
| **Global CO₂ intensity of electricity** | **~0.45 tCO₂/MWh** | International Energy Agency (IEA), *World Energy Outlook 2025* |
| **Renewable share in global power generation** | **26 %** (2023) | IEA, *Renewables 2024* |
| **Global carbon budget remaining at 1.5 °C pathway** | **≈ 200 GtCO₂** (as of 2023) | IPCC AR6, *Climate Change and the Anthropocene* |
| **Net‑zero pledges by country (publicly announced)** | **>90 %** of G7 & G20 economies | Climate Action Tracker, 2024 update |
| **Global green finance flows** | **$2.5 trn** (FY 2023) | Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA), *Sustainable Finance Report 2024* |
| **Projected climate‑related economic losses (global)** | **$1–2 trn per year by 2030** | World Economic Forum, *Future of the Global Economy 2024* |

### Key Take‑aways

- The world is still on a **>1.5 °C trajectory**, with cumulative emissions far exceeding the remaining budget.
- **Renewables** are growing rapidly but still lag behind fossil fuel expansion in certain regions (e.g., Africa, parts of Asia).
- **Carbon removal technologies** (BECCS, direct air capture) are at early commercial stages; natural solutions (afforestation, soil carbon sequestration) have large potential but face scaling barriers.
