## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global average temperature rise** | +1.1 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2023 mean) | NASA GISS, 2024 report |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions (2022)** | 36.6 GtCO₂e | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29% of global electricity generation (2023) | International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2024 |
| **Net‑zero pledges by major economies** | 44 countries, 19 regions, 14 large corporations pledged net‑zero by 2050 or earlier | UNFCCC Net‑Zero Tracker 2024 |
| **Carbon intensity of global GDP** | 3.5 tCO₂e per $1,000 (2019 baseline) – still above the 2.8 tCO₂e target for 2030 | World Bank “Climate Change Knowledge Portal” |
| **Deforestation rate (global)** | 10 million ha/year (2023 estimate) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Sea‑level rise** | ~4.5 mm/yr average (1993–2022) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Extreme heat days** | 25% increase since 1970 (global average) | NOAA Climate Data Record, 2024 |

### Key Takeaway
The planet is on a trajectory that will exceed the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C target unless emissions fall by ~45 GtCO₂e per year by 2030 and net‑zero is achieved by 2050 globally.
