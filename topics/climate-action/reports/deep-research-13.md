## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023/24) | Source |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | 36.6 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (average 2023) | NOAA, Earth System Research Laboratory |
| **Average global temperature rise since pre‑industrial** | +1.09 °C | IPCC, AR6 Climate Change 2022 Summary for Policymakers |
| **Sea‑level rise (annual mean)** | 4.62 mm yr⁻¹ (2019–2023) | CSIRO, *Global Sea Level* |
| **Annual renewable electricity generation share** | 29% of global electricity supply | REN21, *Renewables Global Status Report 2024* |
| **Net‑zero pledges by nations (public commitments)** | 190+ countries signed Paris Agreement; 145 with net‑zero targets | UNFCCC, *Paris Agreement Database* |
| **Global climate finance delivered** | $532 bn in 2023 (official development assistance + private sector) | Climate Finance Tracker 2024 |
| **Carbon price (global average)** | €45–€70 per tonne of CO₂e (2024) | World Bank, *Climate Action Tracker* |

### Key Takeaways
- Global emissions are rising at ~0.5 GtCO₂/yr, far above the trajectory needed for a 1.5 °C pathway.
- Renewable energy penetration has increased by ~7 pp in the last decade but still lags behind the scale required to offset fossil fuel use.
- Climate finance remains below the $100 bn/year threshold projected by the IPCC for adequate adaptation and mitigation.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑24)

### 3.1 Technological Innovations
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC)**: X‑Capture’s new plant in Texas achieved >70% efficiency at $90/tCO₂, a 30 % cost reduction over previous models.  
- **Perovskite Solar Cells**: Commercial scale deployment by SunTech Energy; power conversion efficiency now 24%, with projected cost parity to silicon within 3 years.  
- **Battery‑to‑Grid (B2G) Storage**: Tesla Powerpack + Megapack integration in Germany’s grid restored stability during the 2024 heatwave, proving viability of large‑scale battery fleets.

### 3.2 Policy & Governance
- **EU Climate Law**: Effective 1 Jan 2025, mandates net‑zero by 2050 with legally binding intermediate targets.  
- **US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 202
