## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2024)

| Indicator | Latest Value | Source |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Global mean temperature** | +1.11 °C above pre‑industrial baseline (2015–2020) | NASA GISS, 2024 Climate Change Report |
| **CO₂ atmospheric concentration** | 421 ppm (average 2023) | NOAA ESRL, 2024 |
| **Annual anthropogenic CO₂ emissions** | 36.6 GtC in 2023 | Global Carbon Project, 2024 |
| **Per‑capita emissions (2019)** | 5.7 tCO₂e (high), 1.2 tCO₂e (low) | World Bank, 2020 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28.3 % of global generation (2023) | IEA, 2024 |
| **Global renewable capacity added (2023)** | +150 GW (mostly solar & wind) | REN21, 2024 |
| **Net‑zero target adoption** | 74 % of G20 countries have national net‑zero targets by 2050 or sooner | UNFCCC, 2024 |
| **Carbon budget remaining for 1.5 °C pathway** | ~450 GtC (as of 2023) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2022 |
| **Climate‑related extreme events** | 15% increase in cost of damages from 2010–2022 relative to 2000–2009 | OECD Climate Change Outlook 2024 |

### Key Takeaways
- Global warming has crossed the 1.5 °C threshold; remaining carbon budget is shrinking rapidly.
- CO₂ concentrations are rising at ~3 ppm per year, while annual emissions have plateaued since 2018 but still exceed sustainable levels.
- Renewable energy deployment accelerates but remains below the scale needed for a rapid decarbonization trajectory.
