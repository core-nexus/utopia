## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023‑2024)

### 3.1 Science & Technology
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC) Scaling**  
  - *Climeworks* and *Carbon Engineering* launched first commercial DAC plants in Europe with capture cost < $100/ton CO₂, a 30 % reduction from 2022 levels.  
  - IPCC AR6 notes DAC could remove up to 10 GtCO₂ annually by 2050 if deployed at scale.

- **Advanced Battery Chemistry**  
  - Solid‑state lithium‑sulfur batteries achieve 80 Wh/kg energy density, enabling >600 km EV range (Toyota 2024 prototype).  

- **Carbon‑Neutral Synthetic Fuels**  
  - *Carbon Clean* demonstrated a scalable CO₂‑to-fuel platform achieving < 0.5 kg CO₂e per MJ
