## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023‑24) | Trend (2019‑24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature** | +1.12 °C above pre‑industrial (1850‑1900) | ↑ 0.03 °C/yr | NASA GISS, NOAA 2024 |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 419 ppm | ↑ 2.5 ppm/yr | Mauna Loa Observatory, 2024 |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions (industrial + transport)** | 36.3 GtCO₂e | ↓ 1.9 % from 2019 | IEA Net Zero Emissions 2050 Report, 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29.2 % of global generation | ↑ 4.8 %/yr | REN21 Renewables 2024 Review |
| **Global per‑capita renewable energy use** | 7.1 kWh/day | ↑ 0.6 kWh/day | International Energy Agency (IEA) – World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Carbon budget remaining for 1.5 °C target** | ~420 GtCO₂ (with 2030 cut‑back) | ↓ 8 %/yr | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Investment in low‑carbon technologies (FY24)** | $3.9 trn (incl. public & private) | ↑ 10 %/yr | BloombergNEF “Global Energy Transition” 2024 |
| **Global forest cover loss** | 2.1 Mt per year | ↓ 18 %/yr | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment, 2023 |

### Key Take‑aways

* The world is still on track for a 2.7–3.0 °C rise by 2100 if current trajectories continue (IPCC AR6).  
* Renewable electricity share has surged but remains below the 2030 target of 45 % (UNFCCC).  
* Investment in green tech is growing, yet only ~10 % of global GDP (~$4.5 trn) flows into climate‑mitigation projects—below the $5–6 trn per year needed for a rapid transition.
