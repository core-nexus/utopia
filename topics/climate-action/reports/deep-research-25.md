## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature rise** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (1850–1900) | NASA GISS, 2024 |
| **Annual CO₂ emissions (CO₂eq)** | ~36 Gt CO₂eq per year (2023) | IEA “World Energy Outlook” 2024 |
| **Per‑capita emissions** | 5.8 t CO₂eq in 2023 (world average) – 10× higher in USA, 0.2 t in Bangladesh | World Bank, 2023 |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 4.7 mm/yr since 1993 (Argo floats & satellite altimetry) | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Projected temperature by 2100 (RCP8.5)** | +4.8 °C – +7.2 °C | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2023 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29% of global power generation in 2023 | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Global green‑bond issuance (2023)** | $1.5 trillion (record) | Climate Bonds Initiative |
| **Carbon price (global average)** | $45/tonne (2024, weighted by trading volume) | Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition |

**Key take‑aways**

* Global temperature is already 1 °C above pre‑industrial; the Paris Agreement target of ≤2 °C requires rapid decarbonisation.  
* CO₂ emissions are rising despite policy initiatives—particularly from coal in Asia and transport in emerging economies.  
* Renewable penetration is growing, but fossil fuel capacity additions still outpace retirements.
