## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2023–24)

| Indicator | Latest Value | Source | Trend |
|-----------|--------------|--------|-------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (April 2024) | NOAA ESRL, Global Monitoring Laboratory | +0.9 ppm/year (steady rise) |
| **Global mean temperature anomaly** | +1.08 °C vs pre‑industrial (2023 average) | NASA GISS, NOAA, HadCRUT | 1.6 °C increase since 1850; record high in 2023 |
| **Annual global greenhouse gas emissions** | 59 GtCO₂eq (2022 estimate) | UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2024 | Slight decline after 2019 peak, but still >45 % above 1990 levels |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28.8 % of total generation (2023) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2025 | +2 ppy growth, approaching 30 % by 2030 |
| **Carbon budget remaining at 1.5 °C pathway** | ~300 GtCO₂ (remaining until 2030) | IPCC AR6 WG1 | Urgent need to cut emissions >50 % by 2030 |
| **Global forest loss** | 12 Mt of tree cover lost per year (2023) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 | Slight decline due to reforestation, but still high |
| **Sea‑level rise rate** | 3.7 mm/yr (2019–2023 average) | IPCC AR6 WG1 | Accelerating; projected 12–30 cm by 2100 under RCP8.5 |

### Key Takeaway
- Emissions are still far above the Paris‑Agreement trajectory.  
- Renewable penetration is growing but must accelerate to meet 2050 net‑zero targets.  
- The climate system is showing rapid feedbacks (e.g., permafrost thaw, methane release) that amplify warming.
