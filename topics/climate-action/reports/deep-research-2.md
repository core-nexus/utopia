## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest year) | Source |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Global average temperature rise** | +1.11 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2010–2022 mean) | NASA GISS, NOAA 2024 Climate Report |
| **CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (Feb 2025) | NOAA ESRL Global Monitoring Laboratory |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | 36.3 GtCO₂ (2023) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Net anthropogenic methane emissions** | 0.78 GtCH₄ yr⁻¹ (2022) | UNEP Emission Gap Report 2024 |
| **Global carbon budget remaining for <1.5 °C pathway** | ~400 GtCO₂ by 2030, ~800 GtCO₂ by 2050 | IPCC AR6 WG1 2023 |
| **Renewable electricity share (world)** | 29% of total generation (2023) | IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 |
| **Global investment in clean tech** | $2.5 trn (FY24) | BloombergNEF, Global Clean Energy Finance Report 2024 |
| **Per‑capita CO₂ emissions** | 6.5 tCO₂ (global mean, 2023) – 0.1 tCO₂ in sub‑Saharan Africa, 14 tCO₂ in USA | World Bank DataBank 2024 |
| **Deforestation rate** | 7.3 MtC yr⁻¹ (2022) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2023 |
| **Sea‑level rise** | 4.6 mm yr⁻¹ (2000–2023 average) | IPCC AR6 WG1 2023 |

### Key Takeaways

* The global temperature is now over a decade above the pre‑industrial baseline, with recent warming rates accelerating.
* CO₂ concentrations are approaching 425 ppm, a level not seen for ~3 million years.
* Renewable energy capacity growth has accelerated, but fossil fuel emissions continue to dominate the grid.
* Investment in clean technologies is rising, yet it remains below the scale required to meet Paris targets.
