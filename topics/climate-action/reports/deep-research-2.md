## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Latest Value (2023–24) | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (≈ 42 % higher than pre‑industrial levels) | NOAA, CO₂ Monthly Update |
| **Global mean surface temperature** | +1.12 °C above pre‑industrial baseline (2023 average) | NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis |
| **Annual global fossil‑fuel CO₂ emissions** | 36.8 GtCO₂ (≈ +0.5 % YoY) | IEA “World Energy Outlook 2024” |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29 % of total generation; 46 % of new capacity additions | REN21 Renewables Global Status Report 2024 |
| **Global carbon budget remaining (1.5 °C)** | ~350–400 GtCO₂ (≈ 10 years at current rate) | IPCC AR6 WG1, Carbon Budget Analysis |
| **Deforestation rate** | 10 million ha/yr (≈ 0.4 % of global forest cover) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2023 |
| **Land‑use emissions** | ~7.5 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ | IPCC AR6 WG1 |
| **Global investment in climate solutions** | $2.8 trillion (FY 2023, including public & private) | Climate Policy Initiative “Climate Investment Trends” |

### Key Take‑aways
* The planet is on a trajectory that will exceed the 1.5 °C limit by ~2030 unless emissions are cut sharply.
* Renewable generation is growing fastest in history, but fossil fuel use remains high, especially in emerging economies.
* Deforestation and land‑use change still contribute roughly 20 % of global anthropogenic CO₂.
