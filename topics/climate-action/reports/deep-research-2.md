## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean temperature rise** (since pre‑industrial) | +1.11 °C (2023 average) | NASA GISS, 2024 Climate Report |
| **Projected temperature by 2100** (RCP8.5) | +4.3–6.7 °C | IPCC AR6 WG1, 2022 |
| **CO₂ atmospheric concentration** | 421 ppm (April 2024) | NOAA Earth System Research Lab |
| **Annual global CO₂ emissions** | 36.3 GtC/year (2023) | Global Carbon Project 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28.2 % of total generation (2023) | IEA, 2024 World Energy Outlook |
| **Global forest cover loss** | 10 Mt ha/yr (2019‑2023 average) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2023 |
| **Carbon budget remaining** (1.5 °C limit) | ~420 GtC (as of 2024) | IPCC AR6, 2022 |
| **Climate finance pledged by developed countries** | $431 bn in 2023 (including public & private) | OECD Climate Finance Tracker 2024 |
| **Private climate investment** | $1.07 trn in clean‑tech capital deployed (2023) | BloombergNEF, 2024 Clean Energy Outlook |

### Key Take‑aways
* Global emissions remain at historic highs; the world is on track for >2 °C warming unless rapid decarbonisation occurs.
* Renewable penetration has accelerated, but coal and gas still dominate many regions.
* Forest loss continues to undermine carbon sequestration efforts despite a global moratorium on deforestation in 2020.
