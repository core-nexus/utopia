## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions (anthropogenic)** | 36.3 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ (2022) – up 1.9 % YoY | IEA, *World Energy Outlook 2024* |
| **Temperature anomaly** | +1.11 °C above pre‑industrial (2024 average) | NOAA, *Global Climate Report – Dec 2023* |
| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (April 2024) | Mauna Loa Observatory |
| **Sea‑level rise (global mean)** | +4.6 mm yr⁻¹ (2020–2022 trend) | IPCC, *AR6 WG1* |
| **Renewable energy share of global electricity** | 29 % (2023) – up from 26 % in 2019 | REN21, *Renewables Global Status Report 2024* |
| **Net‑zero pledges (corporate)** | 2,400+ companies, representing ~55 % of global market cap | CDP, *Corporate Climate Pledges 2023* |
| **Climate finance – public & private** | $1.2 trn pledged in 2023; actual disbursements: $950 bn (public), $280 bn (private) | UNFCCC, *Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2024* |
| **Carbon removal projects** | 200+ large‑scale BECCS & direct air capture (DAC) facilities >1 MtCO₂/yr combined | Global Carbon Capture Network |

### Key Take‑aways
- Global CO₂ emissions have plateaued but remain above the 1.5 °C trajectory; urgent decarbonisation is required.
- Renewable energy penetration has accelerated, yet fossil fuels still dominate electricity generation in many regions.
- Climate finance flows are growing but lag behind the $4–6 trn needed annually to meet Paris goals.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–2024)

| Year | Development | Impact / Significance | Source |
|------|-------------|-----------------------|--------|
| **2023** | *World Energy Outlook* predicts that solar PV costs will drop to <$0.05/kWh by 2035, making it the cheapest electricity source worldwide. | Accelerates grid decarbonisation in both developed and developing markets. | IEA |
| **2023** | First commercial-scale DAC plant in the U.S. (Climeworks “DAC‑US”) captures 1 MtCO₂/yr at <$100/ton CO₂ | Demonstrates scalability of negative emissions tech. | Climeworks |
| **2024** | *IPCC AR6* releases “Climate Change 2024” assessment, concluding that limiting warming to 1.5 °C requires global net‑zero by ~2050 and a 55–60 % reduction in CO₂ emissions by 2030. | Sets new policy urgency benchmarks. | IPCC |
| **2024** | Launch
