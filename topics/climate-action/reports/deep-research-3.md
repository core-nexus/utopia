| **Atmospheric CO₂ concentration** | 421 ppm (April 2024) | NOAA ESRL, Global Monitoring Report |
| **Annual anthropogenic CO₂ emissions** | 36.3 GtCO₂e (2022) – 6% decline YoY | IEA “World Energy Outlook 2024” |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 28 % of global power generation | International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2024 Annual Review |
| **Global forest loss** | 10.3 million ha/year (2019‑2022 average) | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| **Per‑capita renewable capacity installed (world)** | 25 kW per person | World Bank, “Renewable Energy Capacity” dataset |
