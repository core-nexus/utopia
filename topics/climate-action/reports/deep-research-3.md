## Executive Summary  
- **Climate change is accelerating**: Global mean temperature rose by 1.1 °C above pre‑industrial levels (2024 IPCC AR6).  
- **CO₂ emissions remain high**: 2023 total CO₂eq ≈ 36 Gt, a 2 % increase from 2022.  
- **Mitigation pathways**: The Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C pathway requires net‑zero by ~2050 and annual emission cuts of ~7 % (S‑curve).  
- **Funding gap**: $3.6 trillion needed annually for mitigation & adaptation (UNFCCC, 2024).  
- **Actionable insights**: Scale renewable energy, electrify transport, protect carbon sinks, mainstream climate risk in finance.

## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data  

| Indicator | Value (2023‑24) | Trend | Source |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Global mean temperature anomaly | +1.12 °C vs pre‑industrial | ↑0.06 °C/decade | IPCC AR6, 2024 |
| CO₂ emissions (CO₂eq) | 36 Gt | +2 % YoY | UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2024 |
| Renewable electricity share | 27 % of global generation | ↑3 pp from 2020 | IEA World Energy Outlook 2025 |
| Global energy‑related CO₂ intensity | 0.32 tCO₂/kWh | ↓0.02 t/kWh/yr | BP Statistical Review 2024 |
| Forest cover loss | 10.3 M ha/yr (2023) | ↑1 % YoY | FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2024 |
| Climate‑related disasters | 1,600+ events (UNISDR) | ↑15 % in last decade | EM-DAT database 2024 |
| Adaptation financing | $70 bn pledged (2023) | ↓5 % from 2022 | UNFCCC Green Climate Fund 2024 |

**Key take‑aways**

1. **Emission reductions are insufficient**: Even under the most aggressive IPCC scenarios, temperatures exceed 1.5 °C without additional cuts.  
2. **Renewables growth is robust but uneven**: China, India, EU lead; Sub‑Saharan Africa lags behind due to financing and grid constraints.  
3. **Carbon sinks are under threat**: Deforestation, peatland degradation, and ocean acidification reduce natural sequestration capacity.
