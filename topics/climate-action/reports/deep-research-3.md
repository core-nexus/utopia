## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data (2024)

| Indicator | Value (latest available) | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Global mean surface temperature rise** | +1.09 °C above pre‑industrial levels (1850–1900) | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6, 2022) |
| **CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere** | 421 ppm (April 2024) | NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory |
| **Annual anthropogenic CO₂ emissions** | 36.3 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ | Global Carbon Project, *Carbon Budget Report* (2024) |
| **Energy‑related CO₂ emissions** | 33.1 GtCO₂ yr⁻¹ | International Energy Agency (IEA), *World Energy Outlook* 2024 |
| **Renewable electricity share** | 29.7 % of global power generation | IEA, *Renewables 2024* |
| **Global forest cover** | 4.06 billion ha (≈31 % of land area) | FAO, *FAOSTAT* 2023 |
| **Annual deforestation rate** | 10 m km² yr⁻¹ (≈0.6 % of global forest area) | Global Forest Watch (GFW), 2024 |
| **Per‑capita CO₂ emissions (high‑income)** | 9.7 tCO₂ / yr | OECD, *Emissions Data* 2023 |
| **Per‑capita CO₂ emissions (low‑income)** | 1.2 tCO₂ / yr | OECD, *Emissions Data* 2023 |
| **Global carbon budget to stay ≤1.5 °C** | ~350 GtCO₂ remaining (as of 2024) | IPCC AR6 |
| **Net‑zero target adoption by companies** | 2,300+ firms signed the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) | SBTi, 2024 |

> **Key takeaway:** The climate system is already beyond many of its safe operating limits. Carbon budgets are rapidly being consumed, and emissions continue to rise in emerging economies despite gains in renewables.
