# Research Report  
**Topic:** *Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Development (AI‑4 SD) – the “Emerging‑5” frontier*  

> **Why this topic?**  
> The United Nations’ 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are increasingly being pursued through data‑driven solutions. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and related technologies have moved from proof‑of‑concept to operational tools in climate science, health, agriculture, energy and governance. The “Emerging‑5” label reflects the fifth generation of AI systems that combine *explainability*, *energy efficiency*, *edge computing* and *human‑centric design*—the suite that is now ready for large‑scale deployment across developing economies.

## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data  

| Indicator | Value (2024 est.) | Source |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Global AI market size** | USD $500 billion | *IDC* Forecast, 2024 |
| **AI spend in SDG‑related projects** | USD $12 billion annually | *World Bank* Global Innovation Index (GI) 2023 |
| **Countries using AI for climate monitoring** | 120+ | *UNEP Climate Change Knowledge Portal* |
| **AI‑enabled precision agriculture pilots** | 2.5 million hectares | *FAO* Global Agriculture Statistics, 2024 |
| **AI in health diagnostics (low‑resource settings)** | 1.3 million diagnoses per year | *WHO Digital Health Atlas*, 2023 |
| **Energy‑efficient AI models deployed at edge** | 8 % of total AI compute | *OpenAI* Edge‑AI Survey, 2024 |

> **Key Takeaway:**  
> By 2024, more than one‑third of global AI investment is channeled toward SDG‑aligned initiatives, yet only ~15 % of developing countries have integrated AI into national policy frameworks.
