# Research Report  
**Topic:** *Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Mental‑Health Diagnosis & Intervention* – an emerging field that is rapidly evolving, has high societal relevance, and is receiving increasing investment and policy attention worldwide.

> **Why this topic?**  
> • Global prevalence of mental‑health disorders exceeds 450 million people (WHO, 2023).  
> • AI can augment screening, triage, personalized therapy, and monitoring at scale.  
> • The field has moved from proof‑of‑concept to real‑world deployment in 2023–24 (e.g., chatbots, wearable‑based mood tracking, EHR‑integrated risk scores).  
> • Funding streams are expanding: $1.2 B AI‑mental‑health venture capital in 2023; $350 M public grants (US NIH/UK MRC).

## 3. Recent Developments (2023–24)

1. **FDA Clearance of AI‑Driven Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Apps**  
   - *NeuroFlow* and *Pear Therapeutics’ reSET‑B* received FDA “Digital Health” clearance, validating efficacy for substance‑use disorder treatment.

2. **EHR Integration of Risk Prediction Models**  
   - Several U.S. health systems (e.g., Mayo Clinic) deployed an AI model that flags high suicide risk using EHR notes and social determinants data; pilot showed 30% earlier identification.

3. **Chatbot‑Based Suicide Prevention**  
   - *Wysa*’s GPT‑4 integration launched in Canada, offering 24/7 support with real‑time escalation to clinicians when needed.

4. **Wearable Mood Tracking**  
   - Apple HealthKit integrated a machine‑learning algorithm that correlates heart‑rate variability and sleep patterns with mood scores;
