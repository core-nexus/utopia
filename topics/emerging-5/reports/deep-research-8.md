## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Global Value | Trend 2020–2024* | Source |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|--------|
| **CO₂‑equivalent emissions** (IPCC, 2023) | 36.3 Gt CO₂‑eq | ↑ 1.2 %/yr | IPCC WG1, 2023 |
| **Global AI investment** (venture + corporate) | $18.5 bn/year | ↑ 22 %/yr | CB Insights, 2024 |
| **AI applications in climate science** | 12 k+ publications (scopus) | ↑ 35 %/yr | Scopus 2023–24 |
| **Publicly available AI‑driven climate tools** | 450+ | ↑ 48 %/yr | Climate AI Registry, 2024 |
| **AI‑enabled renewable energy projects** | 1.9 GW deployed | ↑ 25 %/yr | BloombergNEF, 2024 |
| **Funding for AI‑climate research (public)** | $2.8 bn (UNDP + EU) | ↑ 18 %/yr | UNDP, Horizon Europe, 2024 |

\*Trends derived from 5‑year rolling averages (2019–2024).  

**Key take‑aways**

1. **Rapid scaling of AI investment** – outpaces most other climate tech sectors.
2. **Growing deployment in renewable energy and carbon‑capture** – AI is already optimizing wind farms, solar arrays, and CCS plants.
3. **Data gaps remain** – many regions lack high‑resolution satellite or ground‑based sensor data for training AI models.

## 3. Recent Developments & Breakthroughs (2023–24)

1. **AI‑Enhanced Carbon Sequestration Mapping**  
   - *DeepCarbonNet* (MIT/UC Berkeley) achieved 92 % accuracy in mapping forest carbon pools using LiDAR + satellite imagery. Published in *Nature Climate Change*, July 2023.

2. **Real‑Time Renewable Forecasting**  
   - *WindAI* by Siemens Gamesa leveraged transformer models to predict wind speed 48 h ahead with MAE < 0.8 m/s, improving turbine scheduling and reducing curtailment by 18 % (IEEE PES, Jan 2024).

3. **AI‑Driven Climate Resilience Planning**  
   - *ResilientCity* platform (EU Horizon Europe) integrated GIS + ML to produce city‑level flood risk maps within minutes, adopted by > 50 municipalities across the EU (2024).

4. **Generative AI for Policy Simulation**  
   - OpenAI’s *ClimateSim* tool allows policy makers to simulate impact of emission reduction scenarios in real time; pilot with UK Department for Environment in March 2024.

5. **Blockchain + AI for Carbon Credit Verification**  
   - *CarbonLedger* (Consortium of NGOs) uses AI‑verified satellite
