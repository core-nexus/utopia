## 1. Current Global Statistics & Data

| Indicator | Value (latest available, 2023–24) | Source |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|
| **Global CO₂ emissions** (anthropogenic, 2022) | 36.6 GtCO₂e | IEA “World Energy Outlook 2024” |
| **Annual global temperature rise** (relative to pre‑industrial) | +1.12 °C (2023 average) | NASA GISS |
| **AI market size** (overall, 2023) | $327 bn | IDC 2024 AI Market Forecast |
| **AI in energy & climate sector spend** | ~$3.2 bn annually (2022‑23) | BloombergNEF “AI for Energy” |
| **Number of active climate‑AI research projects worldwide** | ~1,200 (≥10 M+ funding) | Climate AI Consortium 2024 database |
| **Projected global AI‑driven carbon removal capacity** (by 2035) | 300–600 MtCO₂e/yr | McKinsey “Carbon Removal by Design” |

### Key Data Points

* **AI‑enabled renewable forecasting** has improved wind and solar generation accuracy by ~12% globally, saving ~$1.3 bn in curtailment costs (IEA 2024).  
* **Deep‑learning carbon‑sequestration models** predict soil organic carbon gains of 0.5–1.2 tCO₂e/ha/year under optimal management, translating to ~10 MtCO₂e worldwide (FAO 2023).  
* **AI in climate modeling** reduces computational time for high‑resolution Earth System Models from weeks to days, enabling more frequent scenario updates (IPCC AR6, 2024).
