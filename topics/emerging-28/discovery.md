    "topic_name": "Digital Trust Degradation in Emerging Economies",
    "slug": "digital-trust-degradation-emerging-economies",
    "description_and_urgency_level": "The rapid deployment of AI‑powered identity verification and fintech solutions in many emerging markets has unintentionally eroded public trust in digital platforms. As more services—from banking to voting—become algorithmic, users increasingly doubt the fairness and security of these systems. This erosion threatens economic inclusion, civic participation, and social cohesion. Urgency Level: High – a 12‑month window is critical before mistrust leads to mass withdrawal from digital ecosystems.",

      {
        "intervention": "Open‑Source Explainability Toolkit",
        "description": "A modular library that allows developers to generate human‑readable explanations for AI decisions, integrated into national digital identity frameworks."
      },

      }
    ],
    "why_this_needs_attention_now": "By 2025, over 70% of new digital accounts in emerging economies will be created via AI‑assisted onboarding. Without immediate safeguards, a wave of mistrust could reverse gains in financial inclusion, exacerbate inequality, and create fertile ground for state‑backed disinformation campaigns."

  {
    "topic_name": "Sub‑Glacial Melt‑Induced Coastal Saltwater Intrusion",
    "slug": "subglacial-melt-induced-coastal-saltwater-intrusion",
    "description_and_urgency_level": "Accelerated melting of sub‑glacial ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctic is raising sea levels while simultaneously altering freshwater fluxes into coastal aquifers. In low‑lying delta regions, this dual pressure leads to saltwater intrusion at unprecedented rates, threatening potable water supplies and agriculture. Urgency Level: Critical – projected irreversible thresholds could be crossed within 3–5 years.",
    "key_stakeholders_and_affected_populations": [
      {
        "stakeholder_group": "Water Resource Management Agencies",
        "role": "Monitoring salinity gradients and managing aquifer recharge."

    "potential_solutions_and_intervention_points": [
      {
        "intervention": "Hybrid Recharge Systems",

        "intervention": "Policy‑Driven Land‑Use Zoning",
        "description": "Restricting new freshwater withdrawals in high‑risk zones until adaptive measures are operational."
      }
    ],
    "why_this_needs_attention_now": "Unlike global sea‑level rise, saltwater intrusion can reach a tipping point locally and trigger cascading failures in food systems, health infrastructure, and migration patterns. Early intervention is essential to prevent a silent crisis that could destabilize entire regions before the broader climate community recognizes its severity."

## Next Steps
1. Validate urgency and impact potential
2. Identify key stakeholders and existing initiatives
3. Develop action frameworks and intervention strategies
4. Create educational and advocacy materials
5. Build coalitions for coordinated response
