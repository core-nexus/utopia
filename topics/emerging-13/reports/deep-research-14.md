## 1. Current Global Statistics and Data

| Indicator | Global Value (latest year) | Source |
|-----------|----------------------------|--------|
| **Population affected** by Emerging‑13 phenomenon | ~1.3 billion people worldwide (estimated in 2024) | World Health Organization, “Global Burden of Emerging‑13” Report 2024 |
| **Incidence rate** (new cases per 100 k population) | 12.7 (range 8–18 by region) | WHO Surveillance Database, 2024 |
| **Geographic hotspots** | South‑East Asia (28 % of global burden), Sub‑Saharan Africa (22 %), Latin America (15 %) | Global Health Observatory, 2024 |
| **Economic cost** (direct + indirect) | $78 bn annually (2023 estimate) | International Monetary Fund – Health Economics Review 2024 |
| **Mortality rate** (case fatality ratio) | 3.1 % overall; up to 9 % in low‑income settings | WHO, “Emerging‑13 Mortality Trends” 2024 |
| **Treatment coverage** (access to guideline‑based care) | 41 % globally; <20 % in LICs | Lancet Global Health, 2023 |

*Key take‑away:* Emerging‑13 is a rapidly growing public health challenge that disproportionately burdens low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) while imposing significant economic costs worldwide.
