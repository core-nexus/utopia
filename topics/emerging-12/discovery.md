    "why_this_needs_attention_now": [
      "Recent satellite data (2024) shows a 15% increase in methane flux from Greenland’s permafrost compared to 2019.",
      "Methane has a global warming potential ~28× that of CO₂ over 100 years; rapid release could accelerate temperature rise beyond 1.5 °C thresholds.",
      "Early action can provide time for technological development and reduce the likelihood of tipping into irreversible climate states."

## Next Steps
1. Validate urgency and impact potential
2. Identify key stakeholders and existing initiatives
3. Develop action frameworks and intervention strategies
4. Create educational and advocacy materials
5. Build coalitions for coordinated response
