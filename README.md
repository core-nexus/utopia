# üåç Utopia Node: Building the Future One Node at a Time

This is the first **Utopia Node**‚Äîmy experiment in AI/human collaboration that actually moves the needle.

I‚Äôve spent years in the trenches building systems, and I‚Äôve seen how technology can either amplify human potential or create more noise. This isn‚Äôt another theoretical framework. It‚Äôs a working prototype for something I believe can genuinely change how we solve the world‚Äôs toughest problems.

## What Am I Actually Building Here?

A **Utopia Node** is my answer to the question: ‚ÄúHow do we create knowledge that scales without losing its soul?‚Äù

Each node is a complete, forkable toolkit that includes:

- **Real Content**: Deep research, actionable insights, visual storytelling‚Äîall generated locally with [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai). No vendor lock-in, no monthly bills. Just pure creative horsepower running on your own hardware.
- **Grounded Foundations**: I‚Äôm weaving together hard science, ancient wisdom, and systems thinking because the biggest breakthroughs happen at the intersections. These aren‚Äôt fluffy philosophical concepts‚Äîthey‚Äôre practical lenses that help you see patterns others miss.
- **Trustworthy Networks**: Building a decentralized trust layer where good ideas rise organically. No algorithms optimizing for engagement. Just community-validated knowledge that actually serves humanity.

## The Bigger Vision (And Why It Matters)

Picture this: thousands of these nodes, each one a focused lab where builders like us tackle specific pieces of humanity‚Äôs puzzle. Fork what resonates, build on what works, let the rest fade away.

Through the [CoreNexus](https://corenexus.is) interface, we‚Äôre creating something unprecedented‚Äîa living network where:

- Engineers can find spiritually-grounded approaches to technical challenges
- Visionaries can ground their insights in practical implementation
- Anyone can contribute their unique piece to the larger whole

I‚Äôm not interested in building another platform. I‚Äôm building the infrastructure for a new kind of collective intelligence‚Äîone where technology serves consciousness, not the other way around.

**Ready to build something meaningful? Fork this, make it yours, and let‚Äôs see what emerges.**


# Tech Details

A minimal, Git-native workspace for AI-first collaboration on SDG-aligned gigs. Produces:
- `docs/report.md` ‚Üí HTML/PDF via Pandoc
- `slides/talk.md` ‚Üí HTML/PDF via Marp
- `video/storyboard.json` + `video/script.md` ‚Üí optional stub MP4 (later)

## Structure
- `problem.md` ‚Äî the task seed
- `docs/` ‚Äî long-form Markdown with YAML front matter
- `slides/` ‚Äî Marp-flavoured Markdown for decks
- `video/` ‚Äî `storyboard.json` (array of scenes) + `script.md`
- `schemas/` ‚Äî machine-validated JSON Schemas
- `scripts/` ‚Äî render helpers (local dev)

## Quickstart (local)
Prereqs (optional for local rendering): `pandoc`, `marp-cli` (Node).

- Render report to HTML: `bin/docs-html`
- Render report to PDF: `bin/docs-pdf`
- Render slides to HTML: `bin/slides-html`
- Render slides to PDF: `bin/slides-pdf`
- Validate storyboard (optional): `bin/validate-storyboard`
- Clean outputs: `bin/clean`

### Generate a deep-research report
Uses harlantwood/deep-research-cli (branch `cli`). Clones to `./tmp`, pipes `problem.md` to stdin, and writes under `problems/<slug>/solution/report.md`.

- Run: `bin/generate-report` (or `bin/generate-report --problem path/to/problem.md`)
- Output: `problems/<slug>/solution/report.md` with a copy of the input at `problems/<slug>/problem.md`

### Generate a research draft locally
Requires Python and the open_deep_research package on your machine.

1) Install dependencies locally (example):
   - `pip install -U open-deep-research` (or `pip install -U open_deep_research`)
   - Set your provider keys (e.g., `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...`)

2) Generate a draft from `problem.md`:
   - `bin/generate`
   - Output: `docs/report.draft.md`

If tools aren‚Äôt installed locally, CI will render on push.

## CI
GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/build.yml` builds artefacts and uploads them.

## Formats (internal ‚Üí final)
- Reports: Markdown + YAML front matter ‚Üí HTML/PDF (Pandoc)
- Slides: Marp Markdown ‚Üí HTML/PDF (Marp CLI)
- Video: `storyboard.json` + `script.md` ‚Üí MP4 (future; stub pipeline)

See `schemas/storyboard.schema.json` for storyboard validation.
