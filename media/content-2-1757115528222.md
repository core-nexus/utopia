| Slide | Title | Key Visuals | Core Message |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Hook** | A split image: overflowing landfill vs. thriving community garden | “Every ton of trash we throw away is an opportunity lost.” |
| 2 | **The Scale of the Problem** | World map with waste‑by‑country heat‑map; bar chart of per‑capita waste | 1 kg of municipal solid waste → 0.7 kg CO₂e, 30 % recyclable but only 20 % actually recycled. |
| 3 | **Why It Matters** | Photo collage: climate‑impacted cities, plastic in oceans, unemployed workers | “Waste is a silent driver of climate change, health crises and lost jobs.” |
| 4 | **Success Stories** | Before/after images of cities (e.g., San Francisco, Seoul) | “Cities that re‑imagine waste have cut emissions by 25 % and created 50k new jobs.” |
| 5 | **The Zero‑Waste Toolkit** | Icons: Source separation, circular design, community composting | “Three pillars: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle + Regenerate.” |
| 6 | **Concrete Actions for Individuals** | Step‑by‑step infographic: ‘My 3‑Day Waste Audit’ | “You can cut your waste by 30 % in one week with simple swaps.” |
