## 2️⃣ Detailed Video Script (≈12 min) – “Zero‑Carbon Communities: Your Power to Change”

### Intro (0:00–0:45)
- **Visual**: Drone shot of a smog‑heavy city → transition to a vibrant, sunlit town.
- **Narrator**: “Every breath we take is tied to the planet’s health. Today, I’ll show you how *your* actions can help us build zero‑carbon communities worldwide.”

### Hook (0:45–1:30)
- **Data Overlay**: “2.8 trillion dollars lost each year to climate damage.”  
- **Narrator**: “That’s the price of inaction – and it’s a price we’re already paying. But we have a solution that works, is proven, and starts with you.”

### Part 1 – The Reality (1:30–3:00)
- **Scene**: Split screen – CO₂‑heavy city vs. clean city.
- **Narrator**: “Right now, 70% of global emissions come from energy & transport. If we don’t change course, our children will inherit a planet that can’t sustain life.”
- **Quick Fact**: “Every minute, 1.5 million people die from climate‑related disasters.”

### Part 2 – Success Stories (3:00–4:30)
- **Copenhagen**: Show footage of bike lanes & wind turbines.
- **Masdar City**: Solar panels in desert.
- **Kigali**: Community solar project.
- **Narrator**: “These places prove zero‑carbon is possible. They’re built on three levers: Energy, Mobility, Food.”

### Part 3 – The Three Pillars (4:30–6:00)
1. **Energy** – Home solar panels, smart meters.
2. **Mobility** – Electric vehicles, bike sharing

## Production Notes
