## 1️⃣ 10‑Slide Presentation Outline  
**Title:** *“The Plastic Pulse: How Every Bottle Counts”*  

| Slide | Title & Visuals | Key Take‑aways | Hook / Question |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **1. Opening – The Invisible Tide** | World map with rising sea level animation; a single plastic bottle floating in the ocean. | Plastic pollution is global, invisible yet deadly. | “What if one bottle could change an entire ecosystem?” |
| **2. The Numbers That Shock** | Graphs: 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic produced (2024), 60% land‑based waste ends up in oceans. | 1 kg of plastic kills 10,000 marine animals. | “Can you imagine the cost of one bottle?” |
| **3. The Human Cost** | Photo collage: fishermen, coastal communities, children playing on polluted beaches. | Plastic harms livelihoods, health & food security. | “Who is paying for our plastic waste?” |
| **4. The Carbon Footprint** | Chart showing 8 % of global CO₂ emissions from plastics (production + disposal). | Plastics are a climate weapon. | “If we treat plastic like fuel, what does that mean?” |
| **5. The Power of One Action** | Split screen: *Takeaway* vs. *No Takeaway*. | Single bottle recycled = 1 kg CO₂ saved; 1 plastic bag avoided = 500 g CO₂ saved. | “What can one person do in a day?” |
| **6. The Circular Economy Blueprint** | Flow diagram: Collect → Re‑use → Recycle → Renew. | Closed loops eliminate waste, create jobs. | “Can we make plastic profitable again?” |
| **7. Case Study – ‘Bottle Bank’ Initiative** | Video clip of community recycling hub in Kenya. | 10 000 bottles recycled → 300 kg CO₂ saved; 200 new jobs created. | “Where can you start a Bottle Bank?” |
| **8. Policy Levers That Work** | List: Deposit‑Return Schemes, Bans on single‑use bags, Extended Producer Responsibility. | Proven to cut waste by up to 70%. | “Which policy would change your city fastest?” |
| **9. Your Toolkit – Action Steps** | Checklist: *Carry a reusable bottle*, *Join a local cleanup*, *Vote for plastic‑friendly policies*. | Concrete, doable actions. | “Ready to be part of the solution?” |
| **10. Closing – The Ripple Effect** | Ripple animation from one bottle to global ocean health. | Collective action creates measurable change. | “What ripple will you create today?” |
