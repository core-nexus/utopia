| **1** | **“The Plastic Ocean: A Global Portrait”** – world map with plastic density heat‑map. | • 8 % of global waste ends up in oceans.<br>• 5–10 Mt of new plastic enters the sea each year.<br>• 80 % of marine debris is plastic. |
| **2** | **“From Trash to Toxin”** – microscopic view of micro‑plastics inside a fish. | • Plastic breaks into 1–100 µm particles.<br>• Bioaccumulates in food webs.<br>• Human health risks: endocrine disruption, inflammation. |
| **3** | **“The Economic Toll”** – bar chart of lost tourism & fishing revenue. | • $120 B per year lost to beach cleanup & fishery decline.<br>• 1 % of global GDP is affected. |
| **4** | **“Three Levers, One Mission”** – “Reduce → Reuse → Recover.” | • Cut single‑use plastics by 50 %. <br>• Expand circular economy infrastructure. <br>• Innovate biodegradable alternatives. |
| **5** | **“Success Stories”** – photo collage of cities that closed plastic bags, coastlines cleaned. | • Stockholm’s ban: 90 % drop in litter.<br>• The “Plastic Free July” movement: 10 M+ participants worldwide. |
| **6** | **“The Power of Numbers”** – interactive slide with real‑time poll (e.g., how many plastic items you use daily). | • Average person uses ~2,000 single‑use plastics/year.<br>• If each person cuts 20% → 160 Mt saved. |
