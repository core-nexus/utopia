**Title:** *“The Plastic‑Free Planet: How Every Drop of Action Today Saves Tomorrow”*  

| Slide | Title & Key Visual | Core Message | Data Hook | Call‑to‑Action (CTA) |
|-------|--------------------|--------------|-----------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Opening Impact** – A satellite image of a single plastic bottle floating in the Pacific Garbage Patch. | “Plastic is everywhere, but it doesn’t have to be.” | *“Every minute, 8 million plastic items are discarded worldwide.”* | Ask: “What if we could halve that number in 3 years?” |
| 2 | **The Scale of the Problem** – World map heat‑map of single‑use plastic consumption per capita. | Highest use in Asia & Africa; global footprint ≈ 300 Mt/year. | *“If the world kept current trends, we’d produce 10 Gt of plastic by 2050.”* | Prompt: “Share this slide to raise awareness.” |
| 3 | **Why It Matters** – Timeline of a bottle’s journey (production → landfill → ocean). | Plastic takes up to 1,000 years to decompose. | *“By 2045, the mass of plastic in the oceans will exceed that of all fish.”* | Invite: “Comment with one fact you learned today.” |
| 4 | **Human & Animal Toll** – Photo collage of wildlife entangled in plastic vs. healthy ecosystems. | Economic cost ≈ $13 B annually for tourism & fisheries. | *“Every year, 100 k marine mammals die from plastic ingestion.”* | Ask: “Tag a friend who loves the ocean.” |
| 5 | **The Solution Framework** – Four pillars: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Innovate. | “These actions create a closed‑loop system.” | *“Countries that cut single‑use plastics by 50 % see a 30 % drop in waste.”* | Prompt: “Which pillar resonates most with you?” |
| 6 | **Success Stories** – Case study of Iceland’s plastic ban + Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan. | Proof that policy + culture shift works. | *“Iceland cut plastic bags by 97 % in 2 years.”* | CTA: “Share your local success story.” |
| 7 | **What You Can Do Today** – Quick‑win checklist (e.g., carry a reusable bag, choose bulk foods). | Concrete actions that add up. | *“If 10 % of people adopt one habit, we cut plastic by 5 Mt/year.”* | Prompt: “Pick one habit and commit to it this week.” |
| 8 | **How Your Action Amplifies** – Flowchart showing ripple effect from individual → community → policy. | One person’s choice can influence peers & lawmakers. | *“Community‑level initiatives have led to city‑wide bans in 80 % of US metros.”* | CTA: “Start a local challenge with friends.” |
| 9 | **Tools & Resources** – QR codes for apps (e.g., RecycleNation, Plastic Free July), links to policy petitions. | Make it easy to act. | *“Over 1.5 M people joined the #PlasticFreeJuly movement last year.”* | Prompt: “Download an app and share your first step.” |
|10| **Call to Action & Closing** – Powerful quote + global pledge graphic. | “We have the science, we have the will, now we need the action.” | *“If every household reduces plastic by 30 %, we could save $2 B in waste management costs.”* | Final CTA: “Join the Global Plastic‑Free Pledge – sign & share on social media!” |
