## 1️⃣ Powerful 10‑Slide Presentation Outline  
**Topic:** *“Reimagining Urban Food Systems: From Waste to Wealth”* – a critical challenge for climate resilience, food security, and economic equity.

| # | Slide Title | Key Message | Visual/Design Cue |
|---|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | **Opening Hook** | “Every year, 1.3 billion tons of edible food goes to waste while millions starve.” | High‑contrast image: a landfill filled with produce vs. an empty plate. |
| 2 | **The Scale of the Problem** | Data carousel – global food waste by weight, carbon footprint (4–8 % of GHGs), and monetary loss. | Animated bar chart that grows as you speak. |
| 3 | **Why Urban Areas Matter** | Cities consume 70 % of food; 80 % of food‑related emissions come from urban supply chains. | Map overlay: city heat maps with waste hotspots. |
| 4 | **The Circular Food Loop** | Introduce the concept: *Collect → Compost/Convert → Feed / Energy → Re‑Feed.* | Infographic loop, each stage highlighted in a different color. |
| 5 | **Success Stories (Micro & Macro)** | Case studies: Detroit’s “Food Recovery” program; Singapore’s vertical farms; Nairobi’s rooftop gardens. | Photo montage + short captions. |
| 6 | **Technology Enablers** | AI‑driven waste sorting, blockchain traceability, anaerobic digesters, and mobile apps for sharing surplus. | Icons & quick demos (video clip of a robot sorting produce). |
| 7 | **Economic Upside** | Jobs created, cost savings, tax incentives, and ROI timelines for municipalities. | Line graph showing cumulative benefits over 5 years. |
| 8 | **Policy Levers** | Subsidies for composting, zoning for food hubs, mandatory “food‑waste” reporting. | Checklist graphic with tick marks. |
| 9 | **Your Role as an Individual & Community** | Three concrete actions: (1) Install a home composter, (2) Join a local food‑sharing group, (3) Vote for sustainable food policies. | Step‑by‑step icons with short text. |
|10 | **Call to Action + Vision** | “Let’s turn every bite into opportunity.” QR code linking to the action portal. | Futuristic city skyline with green roofs & solar panels. |

> **Tip:** Keep each slide 1–2 sentences of copy, rely on visuals and data points. Use a consistent color palette (greens/earth tones) and bold fonts for headlines.

### Intro (0:00–0:45)
- **Scene:** Drone shot of a bustling city at dawn.
- **Narrator:** “Every day, 1.3 billion tons of food meant to nourish people ends up in landfills—turning our cities into giant trash cans. But what if that ‘trash’ could become treasure?”

### Hook – The Problem (0:45–2:00)
- **Graphics:** Animated pie chart showing % waste, GHG emissions, and money lost.
- **On‑screen text:** “Food waste = 4 % of global CO₂.”  
- **Narrator:** “That’s the same as all flights from New York to London for a year.”

### The City’s Role (2:00–3:30)
- **Footage:** City market, delivery trucks, supermarket aisles.  
- **Overlay:** Heat map of waste hotspots.  
- **Narrator:** “Cities consume 70 % of food but generate most of the waste. It’s a paradox we can solve.”

### The Circular Loop (3:30–5:00)
- **Animation:** Cycle graphic – Collect → Compost/Convert → Feed/Energy → Re‑Feed.  
- **Voice‑over:** “Imagine a loop where every discarded bite returns to our tables, farms, or power grids.”

### Success Stories (5:00–7:00)
- **Segments:**
  - *Detroit:* Interview with local organizer, footage of community compost bin.
  - *Singapore:* Drone over vertical farm; interview with agronomist.
  - *Nairobi:* Rooftop garden crew planting.
