## 1️⃣ Powerful 10‑Slide Presentation Outline

| Slide | Title & Focus | Key Visuals | Takeaway |
|-------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **1** | **Opening Hook** – “What if every plate you fill is a planet‑saving act?” | Collage of overflowing trash, empty plates, and a single seed sprouting. | Food waste isn’t just waste; it’s a climate & equity crisis. |
| **2** | **The Scale of the Problem** – 1.3 billion tonnes/year → 30% of global food supply | World map heat‑map + bar chart comparing waste to hunger statistics. | Over half the planet’s edible food is discarded. |
| **3** | **Carbon Cost** – Food waste = 3.3 Gt CO₂e annually | Animated carbon footprints shrinking as waste is reduced. | Every kilogram wasted is a ton of emissions. |
| **4** | **Resource Waste** – Water, land, labor | Infographic: “Water to grow one lettuce vs. water saved if not wasted.” | Food uses 2‑3× more resources than the energy we get back. |
| **5** | **Human Impact** – Hunger & inequity | Split screen: families eating vs. food scraps in landfill. | Waste is inequality; when you waste, someone starves. |
| **6** | **The Lifecycle of a Meal** – From farm to fork → landfill | Flowchart with percentages lost at each stage. | Pinpoint where interventions matter most. |
| **7** | **Success Stories** – 3 real‑world pilots (e.g., Iceland’s “Zero Waste” city, India’s “Food Bank” app) | Before/after photos + metrics. | Actionable models exist and scale. |
| **8** | **Your Role: 5 Immediate Actions** | Checklist graphic: “Shop smart”, “Plan meals”, “Donate”, “Compost”, “Advocate”. | Small habits = big global impact. |
| **9** | **Call‑to‑Action Toolkit** – How to spread the word & join movements | QR code to a shared resource hub + hashtag guide (#ZeroWasteNow). | Empower audience to become change agents. |
| **10** | **Closing Vision** – A world where every bite counts | Time‑lapse of a city’s waste stream turning into thriving gardens. | End with an emotional, hopeful image that stays in viewers’ minds. |
