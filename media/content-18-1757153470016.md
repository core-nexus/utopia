| 5 | **Success Stories – Case Study 2** | Timeline of Seoul’s “Zero‑Waste” policy rollout | Policy + tech = 40 % fewer waste trucks per year. |
| 6 | **Data‑Driven Roadmap** | Gantt chart: 2024‑2030 milestones (policy, infrastructure, behavior) | Clear, actionable timeline for local governments. |
| 7 | **Technology Levers** | Diagram of AI sorting + blockchain traceability | Smart bins, predictive logistics, transparent supply chains. |
| 8 | **Community Power** | Photo of neighborhood “civic compost” event | Grassroots initiatives can cut household waste by 30 %. |
| 9 | **Your Role – 3 Immediate Actions** | Checklist icons (buy bulk, donate, report litter) | Simple steps every citizen can start today. |
|10 | **Call to Action & Vision** | Futuristic city skyline with zero‑waste symbols | Join the movement: policy change, tech adoption, lifestyle shift. |
