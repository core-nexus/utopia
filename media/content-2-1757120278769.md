## 1️⃣ 10‑Slide Presentation Outline  
**Topic:** *“Closing the Global Clean‑Water Gap: A Call to Action”*  

| # | Slide Title | Key Visual | Core Message (Bullet Points) |
|---|-------------|------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | **Opening – The Water Crisis in Numbers** | World map with heat‑map of water scarcity. | • 2 billion people lack safe drinking water. <br>• 4,000 children die daily from water‑borne diseases. |
| 2 | **Why It Matters: Human & Economic Cost** | Split screen: child sick vs. factory closed. | • $1 trillion lost annually in productivity. <br>• Clean water = stronger economies. |
| 3 | **The Science of Clean Water** | Diagram of filtration stages (rain → filter → drink). | • Simple science can remove 99 % of pathogens. <br>• Proven, low‑cost technologies exist. |
| 4 | **Success Stories: 3 Case Studies** | Before/after photos of communities. | • Kenya’s solar‑driven water kiosks (80% adoption). <br>• India’s low‑cost biosand filters (500k units sold). <br>• Brazil’s rain‑water harvesting pilots (30 % reduction in tap use). |
| 5 | **What’s Holding Us Back?** | Bar graph of barriers: cost, policy, awareness. | • $2 bn annual investment gap. <br>• Lack of policy incentives. <br>• Low public awareness of DIY solutions. |
| 6 | **Your Toolbox – 3 Immediate Actions** | Icons: (1) DIY filter kit, (2) Advocate for policy, (3) Donate to micro‑grants. | • Build a household biosand filter in under an hour. <br>• Sign the “Clean Water for All” petition. <br>• Match micro‑grant donations via employer. |
| 7 | **Micro‑Funding Model** | Flowchart of donor → community project → impact metrics. | • $10,000 can provide safe water to 500 people for a year. <br>• Transparent tracking via mobile app. |
| 8 | **How to Scale Locally & Globally** | World map with nodes expanding outward. | • Train local champions (5 min workshops). <br>• Replicate proven models in neighboring regions. |
| 9 | **Measuring Success – KPIs & Impact** | Dashboard: water quality tests, health stats, economic gains. | • 95% reduction in diarrheal cases. <br>• $X saved per household annually. |
|10 | **Call to Action – Join the Movement** | Montage of people taking action (filtering, voting, donating). | • “Take the pledge.” <br>• Share your story on social media with #CleanWaterNow. |

*(Narrative voice‑over + B‑roll; upbeat music in background)*  

**[0:00–0:20] Intro**  
- *Visual*: Drone shot of a bustling city, then zoom into a child drinking from a murky river.  
- **Voice‑over (VO):** “Every day, 2 billion people struggle to find clean water. Today, we’ll show you how the power of one simple action can change that.”

**[0:21–1:30] The Scale of the Problem**  
- *B‑roll*: Infographics, world map heat‑map, children playing in dirty water.  
- **VO:** “In 2024, over 4,000 children die each day from preventable water‑borne illnesses—yet the solution is within reach.”

**[1:31–3:00] The Science Made Simple**  
- *Visual*: Animation of a biosand filter in action.  
- **VO:** “A handful of layers—sand, gravel, charcoal—can remove 99 % of bacteria and parasites. It’s as simple as building your own filtration system at home.”

**[3:01–4:30] Real‑World Success Stories**  
- *B‑roll*: Kenyan kiosks, Indian villages with filters, Brazilian rain barrels.  
- **VO:** “In Kenya, solar‑powered kiosks serve 80 % of the population. In India, biosand filters have saved over half a million lives. And in Brazil, rain‑water harvesting cut tap usage by a third.”

**[4:31–5:30] What’s Holding Us Back?**  
- *Visual*: Graphs of investment gaps, policy road
