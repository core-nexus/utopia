**Topic:** *“Carbon‑Neutral Cities: Turning Urban Heat into Green Opportunity”*  

| Slide | Title & Focus | Key Visuals | Data Point / Quote | One‑Line Takeaway |
|-------|---------------|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Opening – The Heat We’re In** | World map with heat‑island hotspots; a rising thermometer over city skyline | “Urban areas are 3–5 °C hotter than surrounding rural regions” (IPCC) | Cities are the biggest climate change contributors—and the biggest victims. |
| 2 | **Why It Matters Now** | Graph of CO₂ emissions by sector, zoom on transport & buildings | “Transport + buildings = 70% of global CO₂” (IEA) | Immediate action is essential to stay below 1.5 °C. |
| 3 | **The Vision – Carbon‑Neutral City** | Futuristic city with solar roofs, green walls, electric buses | “Global carbon budget left: 350 GtCO₂ by 2030” (UNFCCC) | A zero‑emission city is not a fantasy—it's the roadmap. |
| 4 | **Success Stories – Case Study 1** | Barcelona’s superblocks + rooftop gardens | “Barcelona cut CO₂ by 18% in 3 years” (City Council) | Real cities can lead the change. |
| 5 | **Success Stories – Case Study 2** | Masdar City, UAE | “Masdar is already 25% net‑zero in electricity use” (World Bank) | Innovation thrives when ambition meets policy. |
| 6 | **The Three Pillars of Action** | Icons: Energy, Mobility, Infrastructure | “Switching to renewables cuts emissions by 40%” (IEA) | 1️⃣ Clean energy 2️⃣ Low‑emission transport 3️⃣ Resilient infrastructure. |
| 7 | **Concrete Actions for Residents** | Checklist: solar panel install, car‑pool app, zero‑waste kitchen | “30% of households can cut emissions by 5% with simple changes” (NREL) | Small habits add up to big impacts. |
| 8 | **Policy Levers for City Leaders** | Flowchart: Incentives → Regulations → Public‑private partnership | “Carbon pricing reduces transport emissions by 15–20%” (OECD) | Governments must create the right incentives. |
