## 1️⃣ 10‑Slide Presentation Outline  
*(Topic: “Plastic Pollution in Our Oceans – The Urgent Call to Action”)*  

| # | Slide Title & Key Visual | Core Message (Bullet) | Data Hook | Audience Takeaway |
|---|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Opening – A Single Plastic Bottle** <br>Visual: Macro photo of a bottle in a clear blue sea. | “Every day, 8 million plastic bottles enter the ocean.” | Global daily figure from UN Environment (2024). | Set the scale—this is *your* planet’s problem. |
| 2 | **The Plastic Life Cycle** <br>Infographic: Production → Use → Disposal → Ocean. | Plastic lasts 500–1,000 years; 90% never recycled. | EPA recycling rates. | Highlight the “leak” point—mismanaged waste. |
| 3 | **Impact on Marine Life** <br>Video clip of sea turtles entangled in nets. | 100+ marine species are affected annually. | WWF report: 35,000 marine animals caught each year. | Emphasize the human‑dependent food chain. |
| 4 | **Human Health Link** <br>Microscopic image of microplastics in a glass of tap water. | Microplastics infiltrate our food & drinking water. | CDC study: 1–5 µg per person/day. | Personal stakes—your health is on the line. |
| 5 | **Economic Cost** <br>Chart of lost tourism revenue vs. cleanup cost. | $10.4 billion annual loss to coastal economies. | World Bank data. | Money‑talk: this is a *business* problem too. |
| 6 | **The Power of One** <br>Case study: “Plastic Free July” results in community. | A single community can cut plastic waste by 70%. | Research from The Plastic Pollution Coalition. | Inspiration—change starts locally. |
| 7 | **Action Toolkit – Reduce** <br>Checklist: reusable bags, bottles, food wraps. | Replace single‑use plastics with sustainable alternatives. | Life cycle analysis showing 90% reduction in carbon footprint. | Simple swap list people can adopt today. |
| 8 | **Action Toolkit – Reuse & Repurpose** <br>DIY projects (e.g., bottle planters). | Turning waste into value extends life of plastic. | Upcycling study: 3‑fold increase in product lifespan. | Empower creativity and ownership. |
| 9 | **Action Toolkit – Recycle Properly** <br>Map of local recycling codes, where to drop off. | Correct sorting cuts contamination by 80%. | Municipal recycling stats. | Clear steps—no guesswork. |
|10 | **Call‑to‑Action & Vision** <br>Vision board: Clean beaches, thriving reefs, vibrant economies. | Join the movement—collectively we can reverse plastic pollution by 2030. | UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water). | Commitment pledge slide + QR code to sign a local action plan. |
