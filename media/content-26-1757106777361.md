## 1. 10‑Slide Presentation Outline  
*(Designed for a live or recorded webinar – each slide ~2 min)*  

| # | Slide Title | Key Visuals | Core Message | Take‑away |
|---|-------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | **The Rising Tide: A Reality Check** | Animated global sea‑level rise map (2000‑2050) | Sea level has already risen 15 cm; projections show another 50–80 cm by 2100. | “We’re living in a future that’s already here.” |
| 2 | **Why Coastal Communities Matter** | Photo collage of fishing villages, tourism hotspots, and port cities | 40% of the world’s population lives within 100 km of coast; they drive trade, culture, and food security. | “Protecting coasts protects billions.” |
| 3 | **The Human Cost of Inaction** | Infographic: 1.5 M displaced people by 2030, $2 trillion in economic loss per year | Every year the world loses $120 billion in coastal property value alone. | “Inaction is a silent budget drain.” |
| 4 | **Success Stories That Scale** | Before‑and‑after photos of Barbados’ mangrove restoration; case study: Netherlands’ ‘Room for the River’. | These projects reduced flood risk by 70% and boosted local fisheries. | “Proven solutions exist – they’re replicable.” |
| 5 | **The Science Behind Nature‑Based Solutions** | Diagram of ecosystem services (mangroves, dunes, wetlands) | Ecosystems act as natural buffers; each meter of mangrove can reduce wave height by up to 30%. | “Nature is the most cost‑effective defense.” |
| 6 | **Your Role: The Five Immediate Actions** | Icon grid: policy advocacy, community mapping, micro‑grants, education, carbon offset | Concrete actions people can take in the next 24 hrs. | “You have a toolset ready to deploy.” |
| 7 | **How to Mobilize Local Governments** | Flowchart of lobbying steps; examples of successful petitions (e.g., Miami’s Coastal Resilience Act). | Demonstrates that policy change is within reach with organized pressure. | “Politicians listen when citizens act.” |
| 8 | **Funding the Future: Micro‑Grant Models** | Screenshot of a crowd‑funding platform; pie chart of allocation (30% planting, 20% monitoring, 50% community training). | Shows how small donations can scale into large projects. | “Your $10 can seed a new mangrove nursery.” |
| 9 | **Measuring Impact Together** | Dashboard mock‑up: real‑time data on tree growth, flood reduction, and community income. | Emphasizes transparency & data‑driven accountability. | “Impact is visible; we’re all in the same data set.” |
|10 | **Call to Action – Join the Wave** | Montage of volunteers planting, students learning, policy makers signing. | Urges immediate commitment: sign petition, donate, volunteer, share. | “The tide turns with every hand that lifts.” |

### Segment 1: The Problem (0:30‑2:00)
- **On‑screen graphics:** Rising sea level chart, projected displacement numbers.
- **Interview clip:** Climate scientist explains the speed of change.
- **Narrator:**

### Segment 2: Why It Matters (2:00‑3:30)
- **Footage:** Fishermen catching fish, tourists on beaches, a port bustling with cargo.
- **Data overlay:** 40% of the world lives within 100 km of coast.
- **Narrator:**  
  “Every wave that erodes a shoreline is a ripple through trade, culture, and food security.”

### Segment 3: Success Stories (3:30‑
