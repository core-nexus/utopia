| **1** | **Opening Hook** – “The Rising Tide Is Coming. Are You Ready?” | Animated sea‑level rise map, countdown timer overlay. | Climate change isn’t a distant threat; it’s already reshaping coastlines. |
| **2** | **Why Coastal?** – 30% of the world’s population lives within 100 km of shore. | World map heat‑map of coastal density + demographic icons. | The majority of humanity is at risk—every day we lose homes, jobs, and cultures. |
| **3** | **Science Snapshot** – Data‑driven facts (e.g., *“Sea level has risen 8 mm/yr since 1993”*). | Graphs from NOAA & NASA; satellite images of erosion. | Numbers matter: they tell us what’s happening and where to act. |
| **4** | **Case Study Spotlight** – “Cebu City, Philippines.” | Before‑and‑after photos, video clip of community meeting. | Real stories show the human cost and the power of local action. |
