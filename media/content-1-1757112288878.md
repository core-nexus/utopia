## 2️⃣ Detailed Video Script (≈12 min)  
**Title:** *“Every Seed Counts: How You Can Turn Your City into a Living Forest”*  

### Opening (0:00–0:45)
- **Visual:** Drone footage of a bustling city → zooms to a tree‑covered rooftop garden.  
- **Narration:** “Imagine walking through your neighborhood and seeing the air feel fresher, the heat melt away, and every corner alive with green. That future isn’t science fiction—it’s happening right now, one seed at a time.”

### Hook & Story (0:45–2:00)
- **Cut to:** Interview clip with *Ana*, a community organizer in São Paulo.  
  - Ana: “We started with a single vacant lot and 12 volunteers. Today it’s a canopy of 30 trees, and the kids run through it every day.”  
- **Narration:** “Ana’s story is just one of thousands proving that community urban forestry works.”

### The Problem (2:00–3:30)
- **Graphics:** Heat map overlay + statistics on air pollution.  
- **Data Voice‑over:** “Urban heat islands raise city temperatures by up to 4 °C, increasing energy bills and health risks. Air quality in megacities can exceed WHO limits by 60%.”  

### Why Trees Matter (3:30–5:00)
- **Animated infographic** of CO₂ absorption, shade, stormwater capture.  
- **Narration:** “A single mature tree can absorb 21 kg of CO₂ each year—equivalent to driving a car for 2,300 miles.”  

### Success Stories Montage (5:00–6:30)
- Clips from Melbourne, New York’s High Line, and a small town in Kenya.  
- **Voice‑over:** “From Melbourne’s ‘Tree City’ initiative to Nairobi’s community gardens, cities worldwide are turning concrete into living lungs.”
