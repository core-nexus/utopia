- “Every second, the world creates 4,000 new jobs that require coding, data analysis, or AI literacy—yet over 5 billion people still lack these skills.”  
- Quick cut to a child tapping a tablet.

### **Segment 1: The Reality Check (0:30–2:00)**  
- Graph overlay of global digital skill gap.  
- Host voice‑over: “In the U.S., only 27% of high school graduates can code; in Sub‑Saharan Africa, it’s less than 10%.”

### **Segment 3: Success Story – Finland (3:30–5:00)**  
- Footage of Finnish classrooms, coding clubs.  
- Narrator: “Finland introduced ‘Digital Future’—a curriculum that made coding mandatory by age 12. Two years later, youth unemployment dropped from 15% to 12%.”  
- Quick interview with a Finnish teacher.

### **Segment 4: What You Can Do (5:00–8:00)**
