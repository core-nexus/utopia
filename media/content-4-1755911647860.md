| Slide | Title & Core Message | Visual / Data Hook | Key Take‑away |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **1** | **Hook: “Your City’s Future is Written in the Shoreline”** | Drone shot of a beach eroding, overlaying 2050 projection map. | Climate change is already reshaping our coastlines—now is the time to act. |
| **2** | **The Scale of the Problem** | World map with rising sea‑level heat‑map; stats: 80 % of global GDP at risk by 2035. | Without action, billions will be displaced and economies disrupted. |
| **3** | **What “Resilience” Looks Like** | Before/after images of a city that implemented living shorelines vs concrete seawalls. | Resilient solutions protect people *and* ecosystems. |
| **4** | **Five Proven Strategies** | Icons: ① Green Infrastructure, ② Community‑Led Planning, ③ Adaptive Building Codes, ④ Digital Early‑Warning, ⑤ Policy & Funding Levers. | These five are the “toolkit” for any coastal city. |
| **5** | **Case Study – Rotterdam, Netherlands** | Timeline infographic: 2000–2024; cost savings, economic gains, biodiversity rebound. | Real‑world evidence that smart investment pays off. |
| **6** | **Data‑Driven Decision Making** | Dashboard screenshot showing real‑time wave/sea‑level data feeding into city models. | Data is the new currency for resilience planning. |
| **7** | **The Role of Citizens** | Photo collage of volunteers planting dunes, citizen science apps in use. | Every resident can be a frontline defender. |
| **8** | **Funding & Financing Pathways** | Flowchart: Public‑Private Partnerships → Green Bonds → Climate Funds → Community Grants. | There are *multiple* financial routes—no one size fits all. |
| **9** | **Action Blueprint for Your City (12‑Week Sprint)** | Gantt chart with milestones: 1️⃣ Stakeholder Meeting, 2️⃣ Data Audit, 3️⃣ Pilot Green Barrier, 4️⃣ Launch Awareness Campaign, 5️⃣ Scale & Monitor. | Concrete next steps you can start today. |
| **10** | **Call to Action + Closing Visual** | A rising sun over a restored shoreline; text: “Join the Resilience Movement.” | Together we can rewrite the future—now is the moment. |

## 2️⃣ Video Script – “The Shoreline Revolution” (10–15 min)

**Format:** 1‑person narrator + B‑roll, split into 6 segments.  
**Tone:** Urgent yet hopeful; blend storytelling with hard data.  
**Visuals:** Drone footage, animated infographics, on‑screen text pop‑ups, interviews.

### Intro – (0:00–0:45)
- **Narrator**: “Every year, our coastlines lose 10 km of land—like a slow‑moving tidal wave that erodes homes, jobs, and hope. But what if we could flip the script? Today I’ll show you how cities worldwide are turning their beaches into living defenses—and how *you* can join the movement.”  
- **Visual**: Montage of eroding cliffs, then a city with green dunes.

### Segment 1 – The Problem (0:45–2:30)
- Show global sea‑level rise chart (0.3 m by 2050).  
- Overlay GDP at risk stats.  
- Quick clip of a displaced family.  
- **Narrator**: “By 2035, up to 20% of the world’s population could be living under threat.”

### Segment 2 – What Resilience Means (2:30–4:00)
- Split screen: concrete seawall vs living shoreline.  
- Show biodiversity metrics improving.  
- **Narrator**: “Resilience isn’t just about hard infrastructure; it’s about ecosystems, people, and data working together.”

### Segment 3 – The Five Tools (4:00–6:30)
- Quick animated icons for each tool.  
- Brief real‑world examples (e.g., Singapore’s mangrove
