## 1️⃣ 10‑Slide Presentation Outline  
*(Topic: “The Plastic Footprint of Everyday Food” – a critical issue that ties climate change, ocean health and human well‑to‑be together.)*  

| Slide | Title & Key Visual | Core Message | Data Point / Quote |
|-------|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Title**: “Every Bite Counts: The Plastic in Your Plate” <br> *Visual*: A single plastic wrapper morphing into a sea turtle. | Introduce the problem – plastic pollution from food packaging is invisible but deadly. | “Every year, 300 M tonnes of plastic enter our oceans.” |
| 2 | **The Lifecycle**: From farm to fork | Show how plastic travels through the supply chain. | “80 % of food packaging is single‑use plastic.” |
| 3 | **Hidden Microplastics** | Highlight micro‑plastic presence in foods (fruits, fish, honey). | “A 100‑kg diet can ingest ~5 g of micro‑plastic yearly.” |
| 4 | **Health & Climate Impact** | Link to human health risks and greenhouse gas emissions. | “Food packaging emits 2–3× more CO₂ than the food it protects.” |
| 5 | **Case Study: The ‘Plastic Soup’ in the Pacific** | Visual map of plastic accumulation. | “The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is now larger than Germany.” |
| 6 | **What We’re Doing Now?** | Current policies, bans, recycling rates. | “Only 9 % of all food packaging is recycled globally.” |
| 7 | **Innovations to Save the Plate** | Biodegradable films, edible wrappers, plant‑based fibers. | “Edible rice paper can replace 1 kg of plastic in a single meal.” |
| 8 | **Consumer Power Play** | Practical actions: shop bulk, ask for minimal packaging, support brands with zero‑plastic commitments. | “Switching to bulk reduces your household’s plastic by 30 %.” |
| 9 | **Call to Action – The 3‑Step Plan** | (1) Reduce → (2) Reuse → (3) Advocate | “If 10 % of global consumers cut their food packaging use, we could prevent 12 M tonnes of plastic each year.” |
|10 | **Closing & Vision** | Inspire a future where every bite is clean. | “Imagine a world where your meal leaves no plastic behind.” |

*Tip:* Keep slides minimal – one bold image + one headline + one statistic.
