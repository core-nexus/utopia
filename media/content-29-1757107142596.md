## 2️⃣ Video Script (≈12 min) – “Zero‑Emission Cities: Your City, Your Power”

**[Opening – 0:00–0:30]**  
- **Visual:** Drone footage of a bustling city at sunrise.  
- **Narrator:** “Every breath we take fuels the heat that’s melting glaciers and raising seas. But what if your city could stop this? What if you could turn the lights on with the sun, move without smoke, and build a future where CO₂ is an old‑fashioned word?”

**[Hook – 0:30–1:00]**  
- Show split screen: left side smoggy skyline; right side same skyline but bright, green.  
- **Narrator:** “Today, we’ll walk through the blueprint that’s already turning cities like Copenhagen and Singapore into carbon‑free living rooms for humanity.”
