**Topic:** *“Zero‑Waste Food Systems: Turning Every Bite into a Building Block for Climate Justice”*  

| Slide | Title & Hook | Key Visual | Core Message | Data Point / Quote |
|-------|--------------|------------|---------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Opening – The “Food‑Waste Clock”** | Animated clock that ticks faster each year, showing global food waste volume. | *“Every minute we throw away a kilogram of food is an extra CO₂ emission.”* | 1 kg ≈ 2 kg CO₂e |
| 2 | **The Scale of the Problem** | World map with heat‑map overlay of waste per capita by region. | Global food loss & waste = 30 % of production → $1 trn lost, 8 MtCO₂e emitted. | UN FAO 2023 Report |
| 3 | **Why It Matters – Climate & Equity** | Split image: a polluted sea vs. a thriving farm. | Food waste fuels climate change *and* exacerbates hunger. | “Each ton of food wasted = 1 ton of CO₂e + 0.5 person’s diet.” |
| 4 | **The Triple‑Bottom‑Line Solution** | Venn diagram: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (3Rs) & Circular Economy. | A circular food system turns waste into value. | “Circular economy could save $1.2 trn by 2030.” |
| 5 | **Success Story – The “Zero‑Waste” City** | Photo montage of Barcelona’s zero‑waste initiatives. | Real‑world evidence that systems change is possible. | 70 % reduction in municipal food waste. |
| 6 | **Action at Scale – Policy Levers** | Flowchart: Tax incentives → Producer responsibility → Consumer behavior. | Government can set the rules; we can play them. | “EU Circular Economy Action Plan targets 55 % reduction.” |
| 7 | **Action at Home – Your 5‑Minute Fix** | Step‑by‑step infographic of meal planning, proper storage, composting. | Small habits multiply. | “Proper storage cuts household waste by 30 %.” |
| 8 | **Tech & Innovation – The Smart Plate** | Demo video clip of AI‑powered kitchen assistant. | Technology can help us make smarter choices instantly. | “AI kitchen apps reduce food waste by 15–20 %.” |
| 9 | **Join the Movement – How to Amplify** | Call‑to‑action icons: Share, Sign, Donate, Volunteer. | You are the catalyst for change. | “Every share reaches 4 people on average.” |
|10 | **Closing – The Future We Want** | Montage of thriving farms, clean oceans, smiling families. | *“Let’s turn every bite into a building block for climate justice.”* | “By 2030 we can cut food‑waste CO₂e by 50 %.” |

## 2️⃣ Detailed Video Script (≈12 min) – “Zero‑Waste Food Systems: Your Bite, Our Planet”

**Format:** 4K, high‑energy music, split‑screen storytelling.  
**Structure:** Hook → Problem → Solution → Call to Action.

### Intro (0:00–0:30)
- **Visual:** Fast‑cut montage of food waste (trash cans, landfill, oceans) + upbeat music.
- **Narration:** “Every minute we toss a kilogram of food, the planet pays the price—2 kg CO₂e in emissions and 1 person’s meal lost. That’s what happens when we treat food like trash.”

### Scene 1 – The Scale (0:30–2:00)
- **Visual:** Animated world map showing waste per capita; a ticking clock overlay.
- **Narration + On‑screen text:** “30 % of global food is wasted—$1 trn in lost value, 8 MtCO₂e emitted. That’s the same amount as all aviation fuel for a year.”
- **Expert Clip (FAO Officer):** Quick 10‑second quote: “We’re on the brink; we must act now.”

### Scene 2 – Why It Matters (2:00–3:30)
- **Visual:** Split screen—polluted sea vs. thriving farm.
- **Narration:** “Food waste fuels climate change *and* feeds hunger. For every ton of food wasted, we lose a meal for someone in need.”
- **Data Overlay:** “1 ton = 0.5
