|---|-------------|--------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Hook – The Clock is Ticking** | Global carbon budget exhausted in 2025; cities are the front‑line battleground. | Animated countdown timer + world map with heat‑map of CO₂ emissions. |
| 2 | **Why Cities Matter** | 55% of global GDP, 70% of emissions – urban centers hold leverage. | Infographic: “Cities = 1/3 Emissions, 60% Population”. |
| 3 | **The One‑Year Challenge** | A realistic, time‑bound target: zero net emissions in 12 months for a mid‑size city (e.g., 500k). | Road‑map graphic with milestones. |
| 4 | **Success Stories – Case Study 1** | Copenhagen’s “Zero‑Carbon by 2025” plan shows 20% reduction in first year. | Before/after photos, bar chart of emissions drop. |
| 5 | **Success Stories – Case Study 2** | Medellín’s electric bus fleet cut CO₂ by 30%. | Map overlay showing bus routes, emission curves. |
| 6 | **The Four Pillars of Action** | (1) Energy, (2) Mobility, (3) Waste, (4) Green Infrastructure. | Icon grid + quick stats for each pillar. |
| 7 | **Energy – Solar & Storage** | Deploy rooftop solar + community batteries to cover 40% of demand. | ROI chart, cost‑per‑kWh trend line. |
| 8 | **Mobility – Electrify + Walk** | 50% shift to EVs and 20% increase in active transport by year‑end. | Pie charts, projected savings vs emissions. |
| 9 | **Waste & Green Infrastructure** | Zero landfill waste; 30% of city surface greening. | Tree‑growth timeline, landfill cost comparison. |
