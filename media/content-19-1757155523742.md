**Purpose**: High-impact presentations and video content

## 1️⃣ 10‑Slide Presentation Outline  
**Topic:** *“Rewilding the Urban Grid – Turning Concrete into Carbon‑Sinks”*  

| Slide | Title & Key Visual | Core Message | Data Point / Quote |
|-------|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Opening Hook** – A split screen: a smoggy city vs. a lush vertical forest. | “Cities are the planet’s biggest carbon emitters, but they can also be its greatest carbon absorbers.” | *“Urban areas account for ~70% of global CO₂ emissions yet only cover 3% of land.”* |
| 2 | **The Problem** – Graph of rising city temperatures & air‑quality index. | Heat islands and poor air quality cost millions in health care each year. | *“Every 1 °C rise increases asthma hospital visits by 12%.”* |
| 3 | **What is Rewilding?** – Animated diagram of vertical gardens, green roofs, street trees. | “Rewilding = intentional restoration of natural ecosystems inside the city.” | *“A single green roof can reduce building energy use by up to 30%.”* |
| 4 | **Case Study: Singapore’s ‘Garden City’** – Before/after photos & carbon‑offset chart. | Proof that policy + design works. | *“Singapore cut its CO₂ emissions per capita by 15% over 10 years.”* |
| 5 | **Science Snapshot** – Carbon sequestration rates of different green infrastructures. | “What counts? Trees, moss, algae.” | *“A mature street tree can absorb ~48 kg CO₂ annually.”* |
| 6 | **Economic Upside** – ROI timeline for green roofs & trees. | “Nature pays back in energy savings, health care cuts, and property value.” | *“Green roofs increase property values by 5–10%.”* |
| 7 | **Action Toolkit** – Quick‑start checklist: policy changes, design standards, community gardens. | “You can start at the municipal, corporate or neighborhood level.” | *“City councils that adopt green‑roof mandates see a 2‑year payback.”* |
| 8 | **Citizen Power** – How residents plant trees, support local ordinances, use apps to map greenspaces. | “Every citizen is a steward.” | *“Neighborhood tree‑planting campaigns grow 20% more trees than city programs alone.”* |
| 9 | **Global Roadmap** – Timeline for 2030/2050 targets: 30 % of rooftops green, 50 % of streets lined with trees. | “A coordinated global push can offset 1 Gt CO₂ per year.” | *“If all cities meet the 2030 target, we’ll avoid 4 °C warming.”* |
|10| **Call‑to‑Action & Closing Visual** – A city skyline morphing into a forest canopy. | “Join the rewilding revolution—plant one tree today and inspire your city tomorrow.” | *“Every individual planting a tree adds 1–2 kg CO₂ sequestered.”* |
