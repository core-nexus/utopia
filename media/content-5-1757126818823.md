## 1️⃣ 10‑Slide Presentation Outline  
*(Designed for a 20‑minute talk, 2–3 min per slide)*  

| Slide | Title & Hook | Key Visuals | Core Message | Call‑to‑Action |
|-------|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | **“The Streets Are Our Pulse”** – Animated city map morphing into a heart. | Cityscape + heartbeat line | Cities burn carbon in 80 % of daily traffic. | “Let’s turn streets from pollution to prosperity.” |
| 2 | **Data Snapshot: Carbon by Street Type** – Bar chart (cars, bikes, pedestrians). | Infographic with real‑time data feed | Cars = 70 % of street emissions; 30 % can be reclaimed for green space. | “Know your city’s emission hotspots.” |
| 3 | **Why It Matters** – Photo montage: smog, kids playing, a child with asthma. | Before/after split‑screen | Climate change is already affecting health and economy. | “Health costs = $1 billion/year in our city alone.” |
| 4 | **Success Story #1** – Bogotá’s Ciclovía (bike‑only Sundays). | Video clip of crowded bike lanes | One day a week, streets become zero‑emission zones. | “What can we do on one day?” |
| 5 | **Success Story #2** – Seoul’s Green Roof & Skywalks. | Drone shot of rooftop gardens | Urban heat islands cut by 3 °C with green roofs. | “Roof = revenue + coolness.” |
| 6 | **The Science of Reclamation** – Diagram: carbon capture, heat reduction, air quality. | Heat‑map overlay on city grid | Each reclaimed meter reduces 0.4 kg CO₂/day & 1 °C heat. | “Reclaim one block → 150 kg CO₂ saved.” |
| 7 | **Concrete Actions for Residents** – 3 quick steps: car‑free days, plant street trees, join local advocacy. | Icons + checklists | Small changes ripple into big impact. | “Pick ONE action today.” |
| 8 | **Tools & Platforms** – City dashboards, mobile apps (e.g., CitiBike, ReclaimMyStreet). | Screenshot of app UI | Data is open; you can track progress. | “Download the app, log your street change.” |
| 9 | **Call‑to‑Action for Policymakers** – Policy brief: “Urban Emission Ordinance” (mandatory bike lanes & green roofs). | Flowchart from policy to outcome | Legislation accelerates transformation. | “Sign the petition for city ordinance.” |
|10 | **Vision of Tomorrow** – Futuristic city with sky gardens, electric buses, zero‑emission streets. | Rendered 3D animation | Our collective action can create livable, climate‑resilient cities. | “Share this vision → #ReclaimTheStreets” |

## 2️⃣ Video Script (≈12 min) – “Reclaim the Streets”

**Format:** 4K cinematic footage + motion graphics + voiceover + on‑camera interviews.

### Opening (0:00–0:45)
- **Scene:** Aerial drone of a smog‑heavy city at dawn.
- **VO:** “Every day, our streets breathe fire. But what if the same roads could cool, clean, and connect us instead?”

### Act 1 – The Problem (0:46–2:30)
- **Footage:** Cars honking, traffic jams, a child coughing in a school hallway.
- **On‑camera Interview 1 (Urban Planner):** “Cars are the biggest source of street pollution—80% of our city’s emissions.”
- **Graphics:** Animated bar chart showing emission distribution.

### Act 2 – The Science (2:31–4:15)
- **Scene:** Microscopic view of carbon molecules turning into green leaves.
- **VO + Graphics:** “Reclaiming even 10% of street space for trees or bike lanes cuts CO₂ by 150 kg per block.”
- **On‑camera Interview 2 (Climate Scientist):** Explains heat island effect and mitigation.

### Act 3 – Real‑World Wins (4:16–6:00)
- **Montage:** Bogotá’s Ciclovía, Seoul’s rooftop gardens.
- **VO:** “Cities worldwide are turning streets into life.”
- **Interview 3 (Local Resident):** “I walk to work on the bike lane; I feel safer
