*(Viral angle: “What If Your Daily Coffee Habit Could Save 10 M Littered Oceans?”)*  

### Opening (0:00–0:45) – Hook
- **Visual:** Slow‑motion coffee pouring, splash turning into a plastic bottle.
- **Narrator:** “Every cup of coffee you drink could be a bottle of plastic in the ocean. What if I told you one simple change could save 10 million liters of marine trash?”

### Segment 1: The Problem (0:45–2:30)
- **Data overlay:** 300M tons/year → 8,000 tons/day.
- **Footage:** Plastic waste on beaches, micro‑plastics in fish.
- **Narrator:** “Plastic doesn’t just disappear—it breaks into millions of invisible particles that poison our seas and, eventually, our plates.”

### Segment 2: The Human Cost (2:30–4:00)
- **Interview clip** with marine biologist + graphic of micro‑plastic ingestion in humans.
- **Narrator:** “Studies show 10% of pregnant women have micro‑plastics in their placenta. That’s a silent threat to the next generation.”

### Segment 3: The Success Stories (4:00–5:30)
- **Montage** of Seoul, San Francisco, Lagos initiatives.
- **On‑screen text:** “City X cut single‑use plastic by 70%.”
- **Narrator:** “Governments and communities are already turning the tide. They’re proving that policy + people = progress.”

### Segment 4: The Power of One (5:30–7:00)
- **Interactive Demo** – Show a reusable coffee cup vs. disposable.
- **Infographic:** “Reusable cups save 1 plastic bottle per use.”
- **Narrator:** “It’s not about perfection; it’s about the cumulative impact of everyday choices.”

### Segment 5: The
