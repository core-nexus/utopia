### Title: “The City That Stopped Trash – And How You Can Do It”

| Time | Scene | Visuals | Voice‑over / Dialogue |
|------|-------|---------|------------------------|
| **0:00–0:30** | Opening Hook | 4‑sec CGI of a landfill morphing into a lush cityscape. | “What if the next time you walk down Main Street, you see… no piles of trash? No smog from methane. Just thriving communities.” |
| **0:31–1:15** | Problem Statement | Drone shot of a bustling urban area; overlay of waste statistics. | “Every person in the world throws away 4 kg of garbage daily. In our city alone, that’s over 40 tons a day—filled into landfills that emit more CO₂ than all our cars combined.” |
| **1:16–2:00** | The Vision | Time‑lapse of a city transforming into a zero‑waste model (e.g., composting facilities, refill stations). | “Imagine a city where waste is not an end but a resource—where every bottle, bag, and plate finds a new life.” |
| **2:01–3:00** | Levers of Change – Reduce | Montage: buying in bulk, reusable bags, meal planning. | “The first lever? *Reduce*. Small shifts—buying in bulk, cutting down on single‑use plastics—cut waste by up to 30 %.” |
| **3:01–4:00** | Levers of Change – Reuse | Footage of community swap meets, repair cafés. | “Next is *Reuse*. Repair cafés and community swaps turn ‘trash’ into treasure.” |
| **4:01–5:00** | Levers of Change – Recycle | Animation of the recycling loop with data on improved rates in cities that invested. | “Finally, *Recycle*—but smarter. Targeted sorting and local processing can push diversion to 75 % or more.” |
| **5:01–6:30** | Real‑World Success | Interview clips with a
