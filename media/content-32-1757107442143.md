## 2️⃣ Video Script – 10–15 Minutes  
**Title:** *“Cool Cities: How Your Roof Can Beat the Heat and Save the Planet”*  

### Opening Hook (0:00–0:45)
- **Visual:** Drone shot of a scorching cityscape, heat haze over rooftops.  
- **Narrator (V.O.):** “Every summer, 1 in 4 people in the world lives in a city that’s hotter than their own homes. But what if your roof could be the antidote? Stay with us – we’ll show you how to turn that heat into clean power and cool streets.”

### Act 1 – The Problem (0:45–2:30)
- **Scene:** Quick montage of heat‑related illnesses, traffic jams, empty parks.  
- **Data Overlay:** WHO stats on heat deaths; $1T+ economic loss.  
- **Narrator:** “Heat isn’t just uncomfortable – it’s deadly and expensive.”

### Act 2 – The Hidden Resource (2:30–4:00)
- **Scene:** Rooftop solar panels, street‑level collectors.  
- **Animation:** Solar radiation hitting a roof → electricity + cooling effect.  
- **Narrator:** “Cities get the sun every day. The trick is to capture it.”

### Act 3 – Success Stories (4:00–6:30)
- **Case 1 – Singapore MRT** (video clip, data).  
- **Case 2 – New York’s Green Roofs** (photos, job stats).  
- **Narrator:** “These cities already use roofs to cool themselves and power transit.”

### Act 4 – Three Pill
