| 5 | **The Science of Biodegradation** – Diagram of micro‑organisms breaking down PET. | “Nature can help, but we need the right conditions.” | • Enzyme X degrades PET in 14 days under optimal temp <br>• 60% faster when combined with heat & UV | Challenge labs to publish a paper on bioremediation. |
