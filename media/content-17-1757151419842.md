| 2 | **Why It Matters – Climate & Health** | CO₂ emissions graph (plastic vs. traditional materials). Infographic: 1 in 10 people exposed to micro‑plastics >50 µm. | “Plastic is a silent carbon emitter and toxin—our health depends on it.” |
| 3 | **The Supply Chain Breakdown** | Flowchart from farm → processing → packaging → consumer. Highlight bottlenecks (e.g., 60 % of food packages are plastic). | “Every link in the chain offers a chance for change.” |
| 4 | **Innovative Alternatives on the Rise** | Side‑by‑side images: biodegradable films, edible coatings, reusable containers. Cite 3 companies leading the shift. | “Technology is already ready—now we need to adopt it.” |
