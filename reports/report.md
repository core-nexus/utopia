# Executive Summary

<Write 5–7 bullets that a policymaker can act on.>

# Problem Statement
Briefly describe water scarcity drivers, saline intrusion, and coastal demand.

# Design Targets
- Daily output: 10–30 m³/day
- Salinity / TDS targets
- Recovery ratio, energy intensity (kWh/m³)

# Technology Options
- Reverse Osmosis (RO): membranes, pre-treatment, brine handling
- Solar coupling: on-grid + PV hybrid, off-grid PV + batteries

# Site Selection
Criteria, grid proximity, intake/outfall constraints, environmental considerations.

# Costs and Financing
CAPEX/OPEX ranges, LCOE/LCOWat, sensitivity to energy prices, financing options.

# Implementation Plan
Phase 0 (scoping), Phase 1 (pilot), Phase 2 (scale). Roles, milestones, KPIs.

# Risks and Mitigations
Technical, environmental, social acceptance, procurement, O&M.
