## Context
Produce a concise yet actionable roadmap for deploying community-scale, solar-powered desalination along Ghana’s coast. Focus on technology options, costs, siting, energy integration, maintenance, and community governance.

## Deliverables
- A long-form report (Markdown) with sources, assumptions, and cost ranges.
- A 10–12 slide deck summarizing key decisions and next steps.
- Optional: a lightweight storyboard for a 60–90s explainer.

## Constraints
- Cite all data sources. Prefer open datasets and 2020+ references.
- Assume pilot budget of USD $250k–$500k; target 10–30 m³/day output.
- Prefer modular, maintainable components available in West Africa.

## Review Criteria
- Technical feasibility, clarity of assumptions, reproducibility of calculations.
- Sensitivity to local context (grid reliability, water quality, O&M skills).
- Clear phasing plan (pilot → scale), with risks and mitigations.
